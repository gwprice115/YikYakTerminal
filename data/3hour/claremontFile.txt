Shoutout to the CMS football team on a rare winning season. I think this justifies hiring even more girls to drive golf carts around and film practices. #bestathletesoncampus

I know I chose to go to a liberal arts college (and I'm happy with my decision) but why do I have to take so many damn GEs? Like, I'm Econ/Accounting. How will Bio and a 4 hour lab help me in any way?

I like folding the end of my blanket before I go to sleep so my feet are tucked into a pocket. And also so nobody will crawl out from under my bed and grab my feet. #childhood

Sometimes I just get random pangs in my heart from how much I love my roommate and best friend here . If I didn't have her, I would probably transfer.

I don't like the premise of hook ups in college cause it's all about power and relieving yourself from your academic stresses. Have sex because of humanness, people. Not your stressed out existence.

I'm suspicious of fish tacos. Like what kind of fish? Be specific. Would you eat a "bird" taco? Would you eat a "mammal" taco?

When your family asks why you don't have a significant other over break just give them an in depth description of the 5C hookup culture and how you have participated. That should shut them up.

At Pitzer, the excuse for not washing your hands after you pee is because it's a waste of water. At CMC, it's because time is money. At Pomona, it's because we don't piss on our hands.

If you ever fuck up something and need to apologize, do not rationalize it.  Apologize, take responsibility and move on.  Rationalizing this will only make the situation worse.

When you go to your girlfriend's Thanksgiving dinner and she asks for stuffing, tell her she already got it last night. Her father will be impressed.

Fact of the night: grand juries refuse an indictment in only 11 of 126,000 cases. Except when a police officer is involved. Then they're refused 80 out of 81 times.

There seems to be a troll (or a few of them) just feeding off the yaks about what happened today. It's truly disgusting that they find it amusing to make fun of such a painful tragedy.

We need to judge these things on a case-by-case basis. Just because many police officers have committed horrible racist acts doesn't make this individual officer guilty of murder.

Fuck that grand jury and fuck everyone using the anonymity of yik yak to make racist comments. Black lives matter, institutionalized racism is a thing and matters, and you are part of the problem.

Not all police are bad. Not all white people are racist. But not all black people (like any other person) are innocent. The court made its decision and people should calm down and think before rioting

Yes we could talk about the law or looters, or how all lives matter. We could reframe this discussion many ways. But think, another young black man just died senselessly--let's talk about justice.

Comparing tragedies is a disgusting thing to do. Whether it's 1 life or 100, it's too much. Both are grand injustices but exist on a different axis of oppression. Stop using one to minimize the other

I would help you pay for that but the way my account is set up is that I have Claremont cash and flex. I ran out of flex two months ago and It will take a couple days to transfer money

As a minority is Claremont, I have mixed feelings about the march. I know that there are a lot of white people here who want to speak out, but part of me thinks it's preaching to the choir.

You truly think you're taking the educated side when you state the idea that somehow ppl must "educate" themselves by remaining neutral but that continues a violent system and just reeks of cowardice

I'm a black man and I wish people would stop saying my life is at stake. No, it isnt, because I obey the law. We aren't animals, it is not unreasonable to expect us to act decently.

I'm a poc who grew up with non-pocs my entire life. I've never considered myself a particularly racially conscious person. Ferguson changed this. How is it that in my 20 years I've never seen justice?

Protests do mean something. They make a change whether people believe it or not. It's an idea that spreads out to others, supplying people with knowledge of what others believe in.

This is about the criminalization of black bodies. We incarcerate a higher % of black people today than South Africa did under apartheid.

You know why they're called the holidays? Because you need to work the rest of the year to take off the weight you put on. If we had no vacation, life would be one big vacation.

Dear 5crightnow, whoever you are: even if I was a curious dude, your apparent level of desperation is definitely a turnoff for me.

It was like let's take the smallest dining hall, not open up all the tables, and put all five campuses in there in 1.5 hours. Maybe Scripps dining hall wasn't the best idea.

Imagine how unsatisfactory life would be if you couldn't swallow delicious food. Like, chew and savour as long as you like but once you're done, time to spit it out. Damn that'd be shitty.

Is it strange that my hookup keeps asking for facials? I mean, I'm sort of uncomfortable doing it, but she is super into it. I guess I'd rather just cum inside her (with a condom of course).

I didn't know I was falling in love with you until I woke up and realized I would sacrifice anything to be there for you.  How can I do that again?  I didn't pay attention the first time.

This time of the semester always makes me realize how messed up my family dynamic is. There are so many people who are excited about going home, and I always dread it.

"I hope he likes your loose pussy" My vagina is a muscle that will go back to the same size after sex. Your penis, however, will never get any bigger.

I miss the days when columnists in college papers were not allowed to use obscenities in their columns. It forced them to articulate their ideas.
