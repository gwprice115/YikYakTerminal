The reason I like guys > 6 foot is I'm 5'8 & thick, and they can usually man handle my ass. Guys my height can't even pick me up.

Sometimes I go to the 5th floor bathroom to cry about everything that has lead to my current disorder. I get mad at the people I love, shut them out and isolate myself. This is why I think of suicide.

Stop asking such stupid questions you idiot and answering other people's questions. I'm here to learn from the professor, not to listen to you try to teach.

If we want true equality in our language we must stop the use of ableism. Saying someone is "blind"or"deaf" to facts, "crippling" a foe, or is"crazy"to do that. The disabled are people, not metaphors.

It's such a turn off when guys are obsessed with seeming "straight" and always have to make sure you know it. Stop. Just be confident in your sexuality, whatever it is.

So there is a new app like Tindr called "the grade". Your profile can get an F, and if you do the app actually kicks you off and you can't use it. No more dick pic creepers or bitchy girls! 👌

I'm so happy for all of you people who get to enjoy a day off for Thanksgiving. Don't forget that there are those of us who have to work. Eat some turkey for your homies.

The hockey team got kicked out of the intramural basketball league at school because they "pronounced the 'F' word too frequently and threw elbows during play." HAHA

Kinda rude to blatantly ignore someone's text. Like they thought about you for long enough to type part of your name and a quick little message. Least you could do is give em a response

It's kinda depressing that we've gotten to the point in our relationship where I take my own clothes off before sex. It was so much more fun when he took them off piece by piece. Let's go back to that

Dear pet 😺, I don't mind you licking your own ass, but being nose deep in it is not acceptable. Basically, we're not cuddling.

It's not that losing weight itself is evil, but when you've had an eating disorder and you know all the short cuts, how do you not fall back into that... I want to do it healthy, but how?

Used to be blind to the privileges us white people have.. Being at the U and still going steady with a girl from a minority group. I can't help but feel moved to do everything in my power to help out.

No one seems to understand what a grand jury is. They weren't deciding his guilt, they were deciding whether there was probable cause for a full trial. There was probable cause. Riots justified.

There are at least two sides to everything; the side that is happy with vomiting media propaganda, and the rest of is who have no idea what actually happened and accept that.

Go to the HC, use a to-go meal, load up on all of the fruits they have, get a cup full of Apple juice and ice cream. Blend it all to make a dank smoothie.

Tips for uncomfortable family Thanksgivings: Eat. Make sure your mouth is always full. Respond with only yes or no, or a grunt if you can get away with it. SURVIVE

Shout out to all the closeted LGBT people who have to return to unsafe family environments this season. Remember that there is nothing wrong with you and that people do love you!

I spent last Thanksgiving with a woman who I was certain she was going to be my wife. This thanksgiving I'm alone and she's gone. Life changes fast in a year.

The art of having sex, without thrusting. When a couple "sticks it in" and then leaves it there to "soak." This has become a common phenomenon with certain groups of Christians(predominately Mormons)

Taking a test you didn't study for is like running though a glass pane; just focus and don't stop and you're good. Then suddenly you're bleeding to death and you're not entirely sure what happened.

What if you could tinder in real life? Like walk up to someone and be like *swipe right* then they're like *swipe right* and then you know you're in and won't be rejected? That would be cool.

Last week, my friend broke up with her boyfriend of 8 months. Last night she had a first date with a guy who ended up spending the night at her place and they had sex. She's 18 and he's 24. Weird?

I bet ΣΧ knew Tyga wouldn't show- like that was apart of their contract deal. Even if they shared some of the ticket sales with him, they'd still make a ton! Think about it..... Conspiracy Theory!
