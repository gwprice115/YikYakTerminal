Finished hw, got started on final papers, and caught up on some Netflix. It's been a great day naked in bed :) Now it's time for food and marijuana I guess.

How can one believe in an all-loving and merciful God that punishes you for fulfilling a biological necessity? (Sex).  Marriage isn't a universal law, it's a human tradition.

If we want true equality in our language we must stop the use of ableism. Saying someone is "blind"or"deaf" to facts, "crippling" a foe, or is"crazy"to do that. The disabled are people, not metaphors.

So there is a new app like Tindr called "the grade". Your profile can get an F, and if you do the app actually kicks you off and you can't use it. No more dick pic creepers or bitchy girls! 👌

Found out the due date for one of my homework was extended. I got really happy. Not because I now have more time for the homework but because I have more time to procrastinate.

I treat my textbook like I treat my fridge: Every half hour I open it, stare blankly at it for about 5 minutes, then close it and continue watching Netflix empty handed.

If you're a homophobe, remember that homophobe is spelled ebohpomoh backwards, which doesn't make any sense. Just like your views.

The burn of liquor feels better than the heartbreak of being in love with someone who doesn't love you back.

Was telling my mom about a new guy I started seeing. She asked how we met, and I had to lie. I couldn't bear the disappointment the truth would bring her, and I didn't want to explain what Tinder was.

This is why we need body cameras. Only cops with something to hide would be against them bc they would protect both the people AND any officer accused of anything.

I am not proud to be American. Recent events have shown me that this country is run by morons and the majority of the population is comprised of idiots.

Wrote two papers today that were also due today.  I've realized two things:  1) Due today/ do today is a beautiful lie 2) I'll probably do this again next week bc in my heart I'm a procrastinator

Awkward moment when you take a shower for the sole reason is that the last shit you took put your butthole on fire

It's 2 in the morning, I'm trying to eat hot Cheetos without waking my roommates up every single time I stick my hand in the bag. The crinkling sounds is just too loud, but I'm hungry. 😭😭😭😫😫

The art of having sex, without thrusting. When a couple "sticks it in" and then leaves it there to "soak." This has become a common phenomenon with certain groups of Christians(predominately Mormons)

Saw a chick driving a brand new Porsche Panamera S. She couldn't even park the freaking thing. If you're gonna have such a nice car, at least learn how to drive it.

What if you could tinder in real life? Like walk up to someone and be like *swipe right* then they're like *swipe right* and then you know you're in and won't be rejected? That would be cool.

I don't care how passionate about your religion you are, if you corner a stressed college gal eating her Einstein's bagel and try to talk about God with her, she's not going to like you.

I bet ΣΧ knew Tyga wouldn't show- like that was apart of their contract deal. Even if they shared some of the ticket sales with him, they'd still make a ton! Think about it..... Conspiracy Theory!
