Look closer at the information you're being fed, evaluate your prejudices, fix them, wisen yourself to the experiences of others (read: listen), learn empathy, be a human being with a heart..

Had a great startup idea. An institution that makes you pay 50k a year to bike to a class you're going to fail. With very little to no sex for consolation. People seem down for that.

When I first came to Stanford I was scared of riding a bike. Now, I can ride a bike while eating a bagel and holding my phone as a bike light. This is what a Stanford degree is worth.

Whenever someone looks up at me as I walk past their desk in the library, I see the same painful look in their eyes that people must see in my eyes when they walk by me.

It's actually really nice to see that on yik yak, there can now be a somewhat open forum to discuss issues like ferguson without getting shamed by the mob of protestors

I am in solidarity with today's protests solely due to the police militarization and civil forfeiture shit that came to light after Ferguson; I agree with the Grand Jury's decision.

Cal Yaks say "Stanford students are all 100% virgins." Clearly they have not peeked at our yik yak yet. Also, wtf Cal, even your insults suck.

We speak two languages of racism here. Overt racism and racial biases. One is easy to see and the other? Not so much. Let's keep the latter in mind when talking about Ferguson.

Whether you got a B or a B+ in that one class, a C or a C+ in another class, it doesn't really matter in the scheme of things. Work hard, but don't overwork yourself. You go to Stanford after all!

I've had 2 members of my family commit suicide. If you are considering or are just in distress, post your location and someone will come. You ARE worth it and you are NOT to blame

After looking at the yak feed of the University that I transferred from to here I have to say I'm so fucking glad I'm not there any more. Thank you Stanford Admissions. I am forever grateful.

Welcome to Dead Week, or more accurately, Zombie Week - the week that they say is dead, but really isn't, and is coming after your brain for good measure.

If you're staying here over break, or even if you're not, I encourage you to wander around campus sometime at 3 or 4am. It helps put things here in a completely new perspective.
