I pray that Wake Forest fraternities know better than to pull anything like Phi Psi did at UVA, but then again I assumed it to be a given to not do that to anyone.

We need to take the UVA case as a learning example. Women shouldn't be scared to report to sexual assault.  Men shouldn't take advantage of (inebriated) women. Stand as one with UVA.

If the UVA article upsets or disgusts you, use it as motivation to NEVER let it happen on our campus. Join PREPARE, find local groups, speak out on your own, and help protect our students.

Tonight I learned how to give politically correct answers. Very few direct answers were given tonight at the Town Hall. Lots of work to do still

Regardless of your opinion about certain campus issues, tonight's town hall underscores exactly why I love this school: at the end of the day, we're a community. And we know we can be better. Go deacs

Sometimes I wish I was a pile of lava so I could just lay around and be warm all the time and no one would bother me.

Coming from a minority student, I think the chalkers are upset at their own faults so they try to blame others. I have rarely seen any racism on this campus.

Does knowing you could have made a better decision necessarily mean you regret the decision you made? In response, a wise man once said, "No Ragrets, nah I'm sayin?? Hahahaha"

The best part about hitting 10,000 Yakarma is gaining access to the phone line where British computer voices read you popular yaks. Keyword: British.

To those complaining that they're not able to leave campus as soon as they want to be able to go home, just be glad you're able to go home before Winter Break. Some of us are stuck without our family.

The saddest part of that drive was that if the wake players had picked up that lateral pass instead of running into each other it would've been a scoop and score. Instead it ended in a punt.

Stop thinking the world is against you. Life goes on and you are more in control of changing your situation than you think. So study hard and then get the rest you deserve. Go deacs

It's really difficult once you realize that you may not outlive your parents or have the chance to fall in love or start a family because of all your health problems.

I never understood why people wait before texting back. If you text me, I will always respond when I read your message because I value the fact that you messaged me, regardless of what I think of you.

Whether people realize it or not, perception IS reality. This makes things like race real, and a legit problem for people whether you talk about it or not...

The GJ met for 70+ hrs, over 25 days, met with more than 60 witnesses and three medical examiners, and undoubtedly considered media reports and the potential consequences of the decision handed down..

I feel like a lot of people don't know how the justice system works. It's not like they got a grand jury together and said hey guys, the kid was black, let's let this one slide.

It wasn't a hate crime, but time and time again black men are punished more severely than white men for the same crime. The actions weren't necessarily unjustified, but the severity was uncalled for.

I honestly don't understand how people can read The testimonials and autopsy report and then be outraged by the verdict the grand jury came to.

If someone presents an opposing argument that you believe is wrong, the best thing you can do is argue back with facts, not with judgment or insults or rage. It devalues your point. Thanks!

If you're lonely on campus tonight/over the next few days, do some online Christmas shopping. Finding gifts and thinking about my family and friends back home makes me feel better.
