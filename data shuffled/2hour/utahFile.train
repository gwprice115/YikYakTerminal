Used to be blind to the privileges us white people have.. Being at the U and still going steady with a girl from a minority group. I can't help but feel moved to do everything in my power to help out.

I commute from Salt Lake and there's not a morning I'm complaining about. I wonder how the people from Draper or Ogden do it.

Just remember that people who put you down aren't happy with some aspect of themselves, you make them uncomfortable, they are jealous, and/or it inflates their self worth because of some insecurity.

Found out how mormons have kids. Since sex is a sin no matter what, the husband is put under anesthesia and his sperm collected. The X chromosome is taken out to ensure a son, the sperm is implanted.

To prepare for Mark's anatomy exam, I went to the strip club. One of the strippers jiggled her boobs and quizzed me on it's musculature. To my surprise, she also took anatomy not too long ago.

Depression is so overpowering, especially when you finally get yourself to the point where it seems like things might be clearing up only to find out just how incredibly wrong you were.

My girlfriend hates when I sneak up on her. According to her lawyer, she also hates when I call her my girlfriend.

Today on the train: a man furnished 100 100 dollar bills from his pocket and then he dropped them. For his sake, let's hope they were counterfeit.

Pro tip: Bikers stop carrying your bikes up and down legacy bridge stairs. There are rails on the edges of the steps to let you roll it up and down with ease. You'll be surprised you didn't notice!

Stop down voting the racial issues of ferguson. Denying it is only making the problem worse. If you truly believe that this wasn't about race, you're an idiot. Period.

Wrote two papers today that were also due today.  I've realized two things:  1) Due today/ do today is a beautiful lie 2) I'll probably do this again next week bc in my heart I'm a procrastinator

I'm in a sorority and I don't go out on the row because when I get drunk it's very apparent how much of a huge ass lesbian I am.

Last week, my friend broke up with her boyfriend of 8 months. Last night she had a first date with a guy who ended up spending the night at her place and they had sex. She's 18 and he's 24. Weird?

So there is a new app like Tindr called "the grade". Your profile can get an F, and if you do the app actually kicks you off and you can't use it. No more dick pic creepers or bitchy girls! 👌

All of the sexually frustrated people on this app need to actually go out and meet people to bang rather than bitch about their dry spells on here.

If we want true equality in our language we must stop the use of ableism. Saying someone is "blind"or"deaf" to facts, "crippling" a foe, or is"crazy"to do that. The disabled are people, not metaphors.

I like my men to be strong, supportive, and firm yet soft enough to be pressed up against. Kind of like a bed. Actually, just like a bed. Maybe I'll just marry my bed.

So if I go and try and start a conversation with a girl, say on the bus, I can say hey cool boots? Like that won't make me seem gay or strike her as weird?

So interesting question. How would a girl react if one of her girl friends came out as a lesbian? How would a guy act if one of his friends came out as gay?

That moment when I realize that I'm not that good looking and fuck, does this mean I have to overcompensate by going to the gym?

No one ever tells you that when your heart breaks you can feel it. Like shards of glass falling into your stomach.

When I dress up and look cute, nobody looks at me.  When I haven't showered in 3 days and look like Voldemort's snake is living in my dead body, 5 guys ask for my number. #collegelogic

If the TA's of this history class actually graded fairly, I would come to class more. All the info or none of the info, you're gonna get a C regardless.

The art of having sex, without thrusting. When a couple "sticks it in" and then leaves it there to "soak." This has become a common phenomenon with certain groups of Christians(predominately Mormons)

I just want to take a girl on a date and treat her right. That's sincere. Maybe girls are tired of all the bs from stupid guys so its harder for real guys to find cool girls.

As someone who has suffered from eating disorders her whole life and been both obese and underweight, stop the body shaming yaks. You have no idea who you're triggering/what they've been through.

Basically new to working out of the gym. Want to buy some non-mom-looking shoes; don't know where to start. What stores? What's a good price point? Best brands? Does brand really matter for a noob?
