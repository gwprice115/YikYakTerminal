That moment when you're taking a huge steamer and the whole dorm walks into the bathroom to put someone in the shower for their birthday.

You're all good people. Choose to be kind to yourself and to people and things around you. Who we are in times of stress is as much of a marker of our character as is who we are in times of plenty.

Dorms should be required to have all you can eat pizza during dead week and finals.

From the quality and horniness of the yaks, I realized that good Stanford people go to their homes for Thanksgiving.
