Sometimes I cry but am never really sure why. Perhaps it's stress, left over feelings for someone I can't have, guilt, knowing that I just helped a friend, or overwhelming appreciation for this world.

Go out with friends, have a great time, meet a cute girl, talk to her for hours, get a little too drunk, leave without getting her number, regret it the next morning. ME EVERY WEEKEND.

People always lie and say that they do not study except when it comes to YikYak where the main subject is finals, shamelessly and anonymously
