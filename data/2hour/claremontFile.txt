"When her bra matches her underwear, you're not the one that planned the sex" haha same goes for if a guy's pubes are trimmed/shaved, you're not the one that planned the sex girl.

I'm very nervous because of something big I have tomorrow, but what helps me is to think that no matter what happens I'll look back on it in a month, a year, 10 years as if nothing happened.

I'm 19 and i've never had a serious boyfriend. I've had guys i talked to but it never went far. I never even kissed one of them.But i do like someone now. Does that look bad? Will that steer him away?

If you start hooking up with a guy and they suck so much at making you feel good that you want to leave, will he turn around and talk shit about you/call you a slut for not making him cum afterwards?

Hey! The clitoris is actually wishbone shaped, and about 9 centimeters long! All that you can see is the apex of the wishbone, which can vary in size just like a penis!

My RA just tried to smother my roommate with a pillow. Roommate responds, "I will literally put my nipple in your mouth". Teal Dot did not prepare me enough for this.

I don't understand why people want to govern everybody else's personal life. Like let other people be wrong or go to hell or whatever you believe. Just do you as best you can and let others do them.

Sometimes I feel weird telling people I go to CMC because I know they're comparing me against the stereotype in their heads and I don't quite fit

Sometimes I question the intelligence of people that go here and it's always reassuring when I walk in to a bathroom and someone hasn't flushed their massive shit. What. The. Actual. Fuck.

As a Mudder, I always get excited when I see a yak about one of us, but then it's usually followed by: "unicycling," "light sabers," or "sorry for staring." My school is so great, but SOOO weird..

I really don't see any reason to argue for the admission of someone who doesn't identify as female into an all women's college. For trans women, it makes all of the sense, but beyond that no.

For room draw, there should be an online version before the real thing where you can see who is where. That way you can try to trade rooms and more effectively coordinate with your friends.

Walked through CMC on the way to morning practice and saw a woman cleaning up scattered beer cans at 6:15 in the morning. Get your shit together, clean it up yourself, or don't make a huge mess CMC.

So the storm didn't bother me 1/2 as much as the Pitzer chickens this morning. Waking up at 6 is cool and all, but I could use some chicken tenders now.

I don't like the premise of hook ups in college cause it's all about power and relieving yourself from your academic stresses. Have sex because of humanness, people. Not your stressed out existence.

I'm suspicious of fish tacos. Like what kind of fish? Be specific. Would you eat a "bird" taco? Would you eat a "mammal" taco?

When your family asks why you don't have a significant other over break just give them an in depth description of the 5C hookup culture and how you have participated. That should shut them up.

At Pitzer, the excuse for not washing your hands after you pee is because it's a waste of water. At CMC, it's because time is money. At Pomona, it's because we don't piss on our hands.

If I wanna get drunk and I wanna have sex but not at the same time, does that mean I'm opposed to hook up culture or not?

You can get protein from eating vagina. The enzymes found in the liquid that a woman's vagina secretes contain a fair amount of protein and, if consumed by the human body, can be used as a supplement.

Please be aware of your anti-Semitic values. It's one thing to openly embrace them and admit to your oppressiveness. It's another to call yourself liberal.

How can you be more upset at the lack of peaceful protest all over the country than the indictment.

Fact of the night: grand juries refuse an indictment in only 11 of 126,000 cases. Except when a police officer is involved. Then they're refused 80 out of 81 times.

We need to judge these things on a case-by-case basis. Just because many police officers have committed horrible racist acts doesn't make this individual officer guilty of murder.

Fuck that grand jury and fuck everyone using the anonymity of yik yak to make racist comments. Black lives matter, institutionalized racism is a thing and matters, and you are part of the problem.

Not all police are bad. Not all white people are racist. But not all black people (like any other person) are innocent. The court made its decision and people should calm down and think before rioting

Yes we could talk about the law or looters, or how all lives matter. We could reframe this discussion many ways. But think, another young black man just died senselessly--let's talk about justice.

Comparing tragedies is a disgusting thing to do. Whether it's 1 life or 100, it's too much. Both are grand injustices but exist on a different axis of oppression. Stop using one to minimize the other

You truly think you're taking the educated side when you state the idea that somehow ppl must "educate" themselves by remaining neutral but that continues a violent system and just reeks of cowardice

I'm a black man and I wish people would stop saying my life is at stake. No, it isnt, because I obey the law. We aren't animals, it is not unreasonable to expect us to act decently.

I'm a poc who grew up with non-pocs my entire life. I've never considered myself a particularly racially conscious person. Ferguson changed this. How is it that in my 20 years I've never seen justice?

Protests do mean something. They make a change whether people believe it or not. It's an idea that spreads out to others, supplying people with knowledge of what others believe in.

If the protests do work that will show how flawed our justice system is. Do we really want a court system that is so easily influenced by public opinion which can sometimes be very uneducated?

Before the black community can protest any further, we really need to figure out what we want the white community to give us. We can't keep shutting them out and self-segregating if we want equality

It was like let's take the smallest dining hall, not open up all the tables, and put all five campuses in there in 1.5 hours. Maybe Scripps dining hall wasn't the best idea.

I have the option of eating at scripps, but it is my goal to not eat at scripps dining hall for all of college.  Looks like I'm gonna starve.

Cons of thanksgiving break yaks: townies came out of the woodwork, yak feed became racist and intolerant. Pros: no mention of Netflix or procrastination. 👏

Just remember children, We all coulda gone to state schools that are just as prestigious, got better GPA's, had way more fun, not wrote a thesis, and had more electives/majors to pick from for less $$

I didn't do any work in the couple days before break, I didn't do any work during break, and I haven't done any work since I've got back. Break was good and stress free. I can't be the only one...

Imagine how unsatisfactory life would be if you couldn't swallow delicious food. Like, chew and savour as long as you like but once you're done, time to spit it out. Damn that'd be shitty.

From someone about to graduate next week: stop stressing over finals, thesis, everything. It'll all take care of itself. Smoke a bowl or have a beer, take a breath, and get to work. YOU GOT THIS!

Yo guys. On ch. 15 #29 for Physics 33, why is power = 15.4((7x10^12)^2*4π)) instead of 15.4((7x10^12)^2*π)? Isn't area for circle = πr^2? Equation: Power = Intensity*Area

Met a cute girl at the dining hall an hour ago. Wish I could talk to her for hours and take her out for a good time.

Yes Netflix, I am still here. Just because I've been relying on the automatic switching of episodes does not mean you can question my loyalty.

Is it strange that my hookup keeps asking for facials? I mean, I'm sort of uncomfortable doing it, but she is super into it. I guess I'd rather just cum inside her (with a condom of course).

Wow. Just realized I wouldn't keep seeing the guy I'm hooking up with if he shaved his facial hair.... Hope I learn to shed my shallowness before her sheds his face.

I have a really messy room and go to cmc.  I try to keep it clean, but it always ends up messy and I feel guilty when the cleaning people clean up my mess.  I wish I could tell them not to clean it.

I miss the days when columnists in college papers were not allowed to use obscenities in their columns. It forced them to articulate their ideas.

I COULD put all my things in storage before I leave for abroad OR I could just abandon a completely furnished dorm room. Options, options, options....

Spotted: jackfernandesfitness leaving block with two girls making out together. Wonder what that threesome looked like, and if it involved protein shakes of any kind.

What do you want, snake? You tear apart my friend's heart, then you try to steal my other friend's date. Watch your actions. Mess with another friend's feelings, and you will be publicly called out.

Well it's definitely hard to wake myself up with an alarm when I'm drunk and hungover.

Apparently I stole a shitload of cookies from the party last night. Don't worry, they did not go to waste... apparently I ate them all too.
