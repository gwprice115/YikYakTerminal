Whenever I see a comment get more upvotes than the original yak, I can't help but think about the lion versus tuna scene from The Other Guys. "Did that go the way you thought it was gonna go? Nope."

When you see that guy who was shitting in the stall next to you at the sink while you both wash your hands. The awkward looks begin.

We need to take the UVA case as a learning example. Women shouldn't be scared to report to sexual assault.  Men shouldn't take advantage of (inebriated) women. Stand as one with UVA.

If the UVA article upsets or disgusts you, use it as motivation to NEVER let it happen on our campus. Join PREPARE, find local groups, speak out on your own, and help protect our students.

The chalk does not surprise me. When racism is discussed in person, there is a lot of backlash for "overreaction." No one likes to have their opinion and experience invalidated.

Crossing the street is a lot more stressful here than New Jersey because in NJ you know no one is going to stop for you but in NC you actually have to watch and see if they wave you across

The saddest part of that drive was that if the wake players had picked up that lateral pass instead of running into each other it would've been a scoop and score. Instead it ended in a punt.

I feel like a lot of people don't know how the justice system works. It's not like they got a grand jury together and said hey guys, the kid was black, let's let this one slide.

It wasn't a hate crime, but time and time again black men are punished more severely than white men for the same crime. The actions weren't necessarily unjustified, but the severity was uncalled for.

2014-11-25 10:27:51### A tip ###
If someone presents an opposing argument that you believe is wrong, the best thing you can do is argue back with facts, not with judgment or insults or rage. It devalues your point. Thanks!

Someone put a bucket of urine outside an associate chaplain's office. Seriously? That's such a shitty thing to do.

I hate having to take so many divisionals, not in a single class for my major makes studying so much worse

Trying to convince a cop that you are sober by preemptively shouting the abc's backward will do little to convince said cop of your sobriety. Also tomorrow is finals, it is ok to be sober this week
