I don't know about everyone else but I'm counting down the minutes until we're stuffing our faces alongside friends and loved ones. Good times.

So tired of watching girls fall for complete assholes who only want sex & drunk hookups. There are nice guys that actually want to take you out and go on adventures.

It's always nice to go to bed and get to stare up at the stars.    Ps. Bought a bunch of glow in dark stars and stuck them all over my room.

Coming to Columbia in a long-distance relationship was the worst idea of my life. It's eating all my time and money trying to make it work, and she keeps being jealous and suspicious. Ugh. What do?

If you don't speak up about Ferguson, if you don't spend your time now speaking out for black lives, you are complicit, you are culpable. Black lives won't matter to America until we all speak out.

I was at NYU and their yaks sucked. I missed the Columbia yaks, my yakkers. It's good to be home again.

It's crazy how the parade is just 2 blocks away from me yet people are watching it on tv miles away. It's cool that people wanna see something that I have the benefit of seeing with my own eyes.

Truth is we put far too much value in people who do not love us. Love is selfless and sacrificial. Invest your energy in people who love to converse and be around you. Don't invest it in a black hole.

Communication is key to good relationships, cliche yes but so very important. If you are "dead" to someone don't invest energy in them. Its that simple. Take risks, ask other girls on dates. Be smart.

Student council should throw a mixer so that we can socialize. And, low key, talking to people I usually notice walking around would be chill.

I'm sorry you didn't "choose" your privilege...I certainly didn't choose to be black and wouldn't if I could, based on current events alone

Bottom line is that the media is exploiting racial tensions to push a narrative. That narrative is that white people are the ruling class and blacks are the proletarian. Media wants socialism now.

Everybody has struggles of their own. Having them is not unique to any race, class, or culture. & Don't mistake the peak level of privilege experienced by 1% of rich whites as applying to all whites.
