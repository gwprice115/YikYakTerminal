I married my ex best friends bf for papers (which she totally arranged) then they both planned for him not to show up to the interview and I was denied my green card. $15k all gone for nothing. Life!

I'm not a fan of big dicks, I prefer them small. Not teeny weeny, just the right size. It's not about the size it's about  what you do with it. Any other females agree with me?

Remember bitches What you put into the universe, you get out of it. So apologize when you're wrong, be a little selfless here and there and do everything with love,compassion and honesty.

If you don't speak up about Ferguson, if you don't spend your time now speaking out for black lives, you are complicit, you are culpable. Black lives won't matter to America until we all speak out.

5 seconds of summer is a pretty horrible band name for 2 reasons. If you are talking about the season, only 5 seconds of it sucks. And if you are fucking Summer and only last 5 seconds,that sucks too.

Another burning question on the mind of my family: "how's college?!" I'll tell you now... It's the same as always. Again, nothing has changed.

Question of the day: "Do you have a boyfriend?"  ...No, nothing has changed. I still don't have a boyfriend. I'll let you know if anything changes.

Today is the day! I'm having dinner with my crush and her family. I'm asking her out AFTER dinner (just in case she says "no" that would be an awkward meal). A man's gotta eat, right?

Best part of thanksgiving is that if your home from college you finally get a home cooked meal and not some shitty dining hall food. Thank goodness for good cooks in the family.

Truth is we put far too much value in people who do not love us. Love is selfless and sacrificial. Invest your energy in people who love to converse and be around you. Don't invest it in a black hole.

Communication is key to good relationships, cliche yes but so very important. If you are "dead" to someone don't invest energy in them. Its that simple. Take risks, ask other girls on dates. Be smart.

The difference between southern and northern racists is like yak and Twitter racists... The south is Twitter, at least owning up to it. While north is repressed/scared and only admits it anonymously.

Be aware your prejudiced language: Giving "white people" the privilege of humanity, but not "blacks" (lack of indication of them as "people")

Everybody has struggles of their own. Having them is not unique to any race, class, or culture. & Don't mistake the peak level of privilege experienced by 1% of rich whites as applying to all whites.

Why are people always complaining about tiniest noises in study rooms? People allowed to cough and move. If that bothers you, stfu and go study in your dorm.

Black empowerment is the last thing a leftist politician wants. The left needs blacks be dependant on leftist politics to support their party. Self relience, responsibility, rationality become taboo.

Sometimes I feel like protest has lost worth here at Columbia. Most I know protest because it is "cool" or "fun", and tend to just feign anger. Protest is meaningless unless it means something to you.

What's a good song about a guy who has sex with you all summer and then when classes start, he ignores you yet still feels the need to snapchat you pictures of him and his friends drinking?

Used to date this girl, we broke up on good terms. Now she lives with her BF and when we hang out in groups she still flirts with me and grabs my ass.  She is in my group of friends, how do I handle?

That awkward moment when during the week, you plan on studying your ass off on the weekend. But then you end up cramming on Sunday.

You know you have procrastinating issues when you woke up at 9:40am and for an hour you've somehow procrastinated getting your phone which is on the other side of the room...
