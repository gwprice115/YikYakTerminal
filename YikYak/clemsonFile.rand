Growing up to non American parents and transitioning into American society is kinda difficult. I feel as if people accept us less. All you other first generation Americans know the struggle.

Hey guys I'm the alpha sigma phi president and I don't appreciate this. It's time you guys show our chapter more respect. We don't deserve this and it needs to stop. Go Greek, go tigers!

Let's face it blacks are the problem. Our crime rate is 5times that of the whites at 1/5th the population. To end racism we need to better ourselves and our community as a whole.

With everything going on, open your mind, heart, soul to love. Fundamental to our vision is a mutual commitment to truthfulness, honor, and responsibility.  I am grateful to be a Clemson gentleman.

After the civil war the north did not allow the south to effectively rebuild to healthy, prosperous states and they still suffer. It's the same case for blacks in the US and slavery.
