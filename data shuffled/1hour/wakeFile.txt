Whenever I see a comment get more upvotes than the original yak, I can't help but think about the lion versus tuna scene from The Other Guys. "Did that go the way you thought it was gonna go? Nope."

When you see that guy who was shitting in the stall next to you at the sink while you both wash your hands. The awkward looks begin.

We need to take the UVA case as a learning example. Women shouldn't be scared to report to sexual assault.  Men shouldn't take advantage of (inebriated) women. Stand as one with UVA.

If the UVA article upsets or disgusts you, use it as motivation to NEVER let it happen on our campus. Join PREPARE, find local groups, speak out on your own, and help protect our students.

People complaining so much about race issues is making the racism on campus so much worse. Try being civil when you address your concerns and people will be civil back.

The chalk does not surprise me. When racism is discussed in person, there is a lot of backlash for "overreaction." No one likes to have their opinion and experience invalidated.

Coming from a minority student, I think the chalkers are upset at their own faults so they try to blame others. I have rarely seen any racism on this campus.

All you freshman are gonna be disappointed by pitsgiving after all this yik yak hype.  Is it better than any other day at the pit?  Yes.  Will it even come close to your mom's cooking?  Hopefully not.

Crossing the street is a lot more stressful here than New Jersey because in NJ you know no one is going to stop for you but in NC you actually have to watch and see if they wave you across

The saddest part of that drive was that if the wake players had picked up that lateral pass instead of running into each other it would've been a scoop and score. Instead it ended in a punt.

Whether people realize it or not, perception IS reality. This makes things like race real, and a legit problem for people whether you talk about it or not...

The GJ met for 70+ hrs, over 25 days, met with more than 60 witnesses and three medical examiners, and undoubtedly considered media reports and the potential consequences of the decision handed down..

It wasn't a hate crime, but time and time again black men are punished more severely than white men for the same crime. The actions weren't necessarily unjustified, but the severity was uncalled for.

My reaction to last night's decision was one of shock and surprise, rather than one of fear. That's called privilege.

If someone presents an opposing argument that you believe is wrong, the best thing you can do is argue back with facts, not with judgment or insults or rage. It devalues your point. Thanks!

"Mom do you need any help?" "No, but thanks for asking!" "You're welcome. It was the last I could do!" But really... it was the very least I could do.

If you're lonely on campus tonight/over the next few days, do some online Christmas shopping. Finding gifts and thinking about my family and friends back home makes me feel better.

Is it just me or does everyone get cereal at the pit during finals week not because they are hungry but because they are high and hungry?

Trying to convince a cop that you are sober by preemptively shouting the abc's backward will do little to convince said cop of your sobriety. Also tomorrow is finals, it is ok to be sober this week
