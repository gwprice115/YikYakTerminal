I wish I could just break out into song and have all the random people around me sing backup while performing some kickass choreo. Is that asking for so much?

When I first came to Stanford I was scared of riding a bike. Now, I can ride a bike while eating a bagel and holding my phone as a bike light. This is what a Stanford degree is worth.

Describing a movie as a "psychological thriller" has a much better ring than describing it as "bringing into question the nature of reality and the strength of your morals".

Part of the reason my grades are so bad is because I'm trying to make up for what I didn't have in high school. Real friends. So now I invest my time in building these friendships.

How can you "not see the injustice at all"? Are you straight up not reading these articles? Or just ignoring all of the statistics that show how biased the system continues to be against black people?

I'm not sure why people are fine with being so excited for thanksgiving. It's a holiday that celebrates a short lived peace ("have some cranberries") before the native Americans were fked. No thanks.

Relationships that break or are made because of the sex confuse me. It seems I'm in the minority for my age group, but hopefully I'll find someone who'd be happy with me with or without great sex.

Welcome to Dead Week, or more accurately, Zombie Week - the week that they say is dead, but really isn't, and is coming after your brain for good measure.

Question for locals: Does the power ever go out here?  I'm from WA, where the power goes out at least 2x/year, often in storms like this morning's. Is the Bay Area just too treeless for power outages?

We speak two languages of racism here. Overt racism and racial biases. One is easy to see and the other? Not so much. Let's keep the latter in mind when talking about Ferguson.
