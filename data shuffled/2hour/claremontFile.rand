I really don't see any reason to argue for the admission of someone who doesn't identify as female into an all women's college. For trans women, it makes all of the sense, but beyond that no.

Is it strange that my hookup keeps asking for facials? I mean, I'm sort of uncomfortable doing it, but she is super into it. I guess I'd rather just cum inside her (with a condom of course).

Can going to the aquarium high and eating pop rocks be my new dual major?

that awkward amount of time between two classes when you could get started on work or do the readings for class and you take a nap instead.

Wake up super early to be prepped for class; fall back asleep and wake up exactly when class ends. Good to be back.

I knew I should've chosen Netflix as my research paper topic instead of drone wars. I am an expert on Netflix.

You can't get mad at me for talking to someone else when you've clearly expressed no interest. Seriously.

Planned on going to be an hour ago, but started masturbating instead. Three orgasms later, I should probably get some sleep, right?
