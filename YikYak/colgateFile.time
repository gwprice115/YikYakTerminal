I'll send my email during Dancefest so people won't realize I think desecration of the flag is a "respectful disturbance." Oh! And I can try to delegitimize "debate" by putting it in quotes!

Our flag doesn't just represent soldiers. It represents the whole country. Things good and bad. Bringing attention to injustice in our country is actually honoring those who fought to have that right.

To promote equality. Everyone will get the same grades on finals. For example those who get an A will have their grade lowered to a B so those who get C's dont feel bad. #equality

The flag is so valued to me and many others because the blood of my brothers and comrades are sewn into its fabric. When you desecrate it you desecrate the memory of those who gave up so much for you.

Weststillman has been vandalized, had things stolen, and to deal with belligerent drunks. None of which end up being the fault of West stillman people. Stop coming to our house to do this shit.
