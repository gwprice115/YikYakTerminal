To prepare for Mark's anatomy exam, I went to the strip club. One of the strippers jiggled her boobs and quizzed me on it's musculature. To my surprise, she also took anatomy not too long ago.

Sometimes I go to the 5th floor bathroom to cry about everything that has lead to my current disorder. I get mad at the people I love, shut them out and isolate myself. This is why I think of suicide.

The most excited I've been all week was finding out I'm going to the T. Swift concert with my 16 and 13 year old sisters. Haters can hate.

Best way to get students to show up? Scheduled quiz. Best way to have lowest class turnout? Day after scheduled quiz.

If we want true equality in our language we must stop the use of ableism. Saying someone is "blind"or"deaf" to facts, "crippling" a foe, or is"crazy"to do that. The disabled are people, not metaphors.

So there is a new app like Tindr called "the grade". Your profile can get an F, and if you do the app actually kicks you off and you can't use it. No more dick pic creepers or bitchy girls! 👌

I really enjoy going for walks to nowhere or ride the trax to nowhere just to experience something different, observe new situations, and just take in this world we live in. That's my idea of fun.

You ever think you don't like someone but as soon as they start showing attention to someone else you get extremely jealous?

White people don't care about minorities and are afraid to bite the race bullet. I'm not afraid to say it. "Liberty and justice for all" my ass.

Why cant we have laws passed by professionals in that field. Like health laws made by doctors, or evironmental laws made by actual environmental scientists. Those politicians dont know shit.

Equality isnt about equal results, its about equal opportunity. Yet America still doesn't give the minority an equal opportunity.

I was told today that I'm good at sex so that's pretty much what's going to get me through the rest of this semester.

Behind every girl's selfie is approximately 47 nearly identical photos that just didn't make the cut.

It's illegal to loot, break into shit and cause complete chaos. But I guess when you're black it's racist to not let you do it.

This is why we need body cameras. Only cops with something to hide would be against them bc they would protect both the people AND any officer accused of anything.

Love how the white race is being singled out. What happened when a white man was shot by a black cop? Nothing, cause we probably heard nothing about the situation

I'm not a racist. I just don't support people whose behavior results in violence, looting, and destruction. If you want change, there are better ways.

The people that down vote yaks that call for people to think about both sides of certain issues are the close minded people who will not make beneficial contributions to the issues..

Just because you have daddy issues doesn't mean you can be a jerk to those who want to treat you like a human. Also stop complaining about how no one good comes into your life. You push them all out.

Anyone know of a place that needs people to study the effect of sleep deprivation? I'd make a good test subject.

Over the break I discovered that watching naked chicks turns me on and because that turns me on, it turns my boyfriend on. I am very sore, very confused, but very satisfied.

The art of having sex, without thrusting. When a couple "sticks it in" and then leaves it there to "soak." This has become a common phenomenon with certain groups of Christians(predominately Mormons)

Saw a chick driving a brand new Porsche Panamera S. She couldn't even park the freaking thing. If you're gonna have such a nice car, at least learn how to drive it.

What if you could tinder in real life? Like walk up to someone and be like *swipe right* then they're like *swipe right* and then you know you're in and won't be rejected? That would be cool.

I don't care how passionate about your religion you are, if you corner a stressed college gal eating her Einstein's bagel and try to talk about God with her, she's not going to like you.

Woke up to a text from my group presentation partner at 9:18 that said: 'We're presenting today'. My class started at 9:10... I think I hit Mach 2 on the freeway.

Don't chant in the lib people come here to study no to listen to protests. Go stand outside the union or something. Don't interrupt classes.

I wonder if the protesters are students. And if so do you think they skip their classes to walk around campus and scream?Or is it just in between their classes.

I got a haircut in strict protest of this "man bun" trend. I can't wait until everyone come to their senses and realize how dumb it is.

If you're arguing with your boyfriend in a car...roll your damn window all the way up so I can't hear it at all or roll it all the way down so I can hear every word. No in-between, bitch. I'm nosy AF.

Just walked all the way to crimson corner this early on a Sunday morning to get myself some croissants, only to be told they don't put out croissants on Sundays. What kind of world is this.
