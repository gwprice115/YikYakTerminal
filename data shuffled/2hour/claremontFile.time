To the guy who is screaming in the study room next to mine: if you are being tortured, I'm sorry and can try to help, if you are screaming bc of the amount of work you have to do, shut the fuck up.

I'm a guy and I don't know how to have sex. I lose rhythm doing doggy and I just don't know HOW to move my hips in missionary. I seriously need some help. Tips and advice? It's just embarrassing.

If you see a guy tonight who looks like he wants to eat some pussy,  go up to him and ask "would you like to eat my pussy?" There's a good chance I'll say yes.

Is it bad if a guy doesn't text you to see if you made it back safely?

Today's one of those days when it hits me that I really have no idea what I want to do with my life, what makes me extremely happy, or what I can do to make it better. I'm also PMSing.

Is there a non painful way to maintain a bald anus? I could really cut down on wiping time so I could get back to this paper.

Listening to epic film scores while studying for finals allows me to believe that I'm not just making flash cards, I'm saving the world. #yourewelcomebitches
