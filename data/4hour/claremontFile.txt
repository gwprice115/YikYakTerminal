I really don't see any reason to argue for the admission of someone who doesn't identify as female into an all women's college. For trans women, it makes all of the sense, but beyond that no.

College is a vicious cycle: you spend time cramming the entire week to make up for the time you wasted being hungover only to go and get smashed again to make up for the hellish week.

I don't like the premise of hook ups in college cause it's all about power and relieving yourself from your academic stresses. Have sex because of humanness, people. Not your stressed out existence.

I know who I am when I'm alone, I'm something else when I see you. You don't understand, you should never know, how easy you are to need

It's tougher to find a loyal friend who truly loves you, than it is to find a boyfriend. Not in this college, but in the world. I love my friends, they always help me get up.

When your family asks why you don't have a significant other over break just give them an in depth description of the 5C hookup culture and how you have participated. That should shut them up.

Please be aware of your anti-Semitic values. It's one thing to openly embrace them and admit to your oppressiveness. It's another to call yourself liberal.

If you ever fuck up something and need to apologize, do not rationalize it.  Apologize, take responsibility and move on.  Rationalizing this will only make the situation worse.

"But not all white people are racist! White lives matter too!" Everyone already knows that. That's not the point. White people don't need defending when the whole damn system stands behind them.

Regardless of what you believe the presented "facts" suggest, it should be inherently disturbing that our justice system doesn't believe that the murder of an unarmed 18 yr old merits a trial.

As a minority is Claremont, I have mixed feelings about the march. I know that there are a lot of white people here who want to speak out, but part of me thinks it's preaching to the choir.

OH from a tour: Claremont McKenna? Isn't that the school that lied about its SAT scores and got kicked off the rankings?

I don't know what to think about Ferguson. I feel like most people with really strong opinions about it don't know everything about the case. How could we? The evidence isn't all public, is it?

Listen up people. Our justice system is some bullshit and you all know it. This isn't just about Ferguson and you all know it. Stop denying how fucked up this really is.

Isn't it great how the whole family makes the dinner together? Mom and daughters spend the day chopping and stirring and baking and cooking, and Dad **carves the turkey!** At 5 pm. For ten minutes.

It was like let's take the smallest dining hall, not open up all the tables, and put all five campuses in there in 1.5 hours. Maybe Scripps dining hall wasn't the best idea.

You were close to me, now you're just going to leave me just like my father left me.  I don't want to deal with that - I don't want to deal with your shit, or my father's shit - any more.

Just take a second, take a breath, understand that these next few weeks will suck but at the end of it all is a bed to catch up on the 8673 hrs of sleep that you're missing.

Study tip: Feeling tired? Need a snack? Eat a bee! Bees are 73% protein, and eating one will give you the adrenaline you need to finish your paper.

Planned on going to be an hour ago, but started masturbating instead. Three orgasms later, I should probably get some sleep, right?

If you think something nice about a person tell them! It doesn't matter if they're a stranger. It can change their day for the better in a split second. If they deserve it tell them.

Menstrual cramps so bad I had to leave class to lie on the bathroom floor and practice deep breathing. If you don't get them, always believe people when they complain about cramps

Is it strange that my hookup keeps asking for facials? I mean, I'm sort of uncomfortable doing it, but she is super into it. I guess I'd rather just cum inside her (with a condom of course).

"I hope he likes your loose pussy" My vagina is a muscle that will go back to the same size after sex. Your penis, however, will never get any bigger.

I miss the days when columnists in college papers were not allowed to use obscenities in their columns. It forced them to articulate their ideas.

I personally put a lot of value on eating right, being in shape, and maintaing a healthy body weight. I don't think it's "biased" or "fat shaming" to look for the same values someone I'd date

Most of the time when you're crying nobody notices your tears. When you're worried, nobody feels your pain. When you're happy, nobody sees your smile. But when you fart just that one time in public...

Strangely enough, I can't wait until I go home so that there isn't so much pressure to hook up with someone every night.

Sending my love to anyone who is staying up late to get shit done. It sucks now, but I'm sure it will pay off later. Hang in there.

Today was a sad night to many people. Don't worry we'll get through together. It gets better even if it doesn't feel like it will.

I hate that I didn't go out last night, but I have too much work. Now I'm kind of lonely, but I know I made the best decision for me. Please tell me others are feeling this too :/
