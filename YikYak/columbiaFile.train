This time of the year is the worst. Have to stay very late in school for finals and hop on the late subways with all kinds of strange weird people. Just saw a stalker, I'm really scared

I understand that subway construction will someday somehow make it a better system but will there ever be one, just one, weekend with no construction? Just one.

Advice: tell your crush you like them this week. If it goes poorly, you have the thanksgiving buffer and Dec to rebuild the friendship. This is the relationship Goldilocks zone. Be brave.

I would pay actual money to not be asked if I have a boyfriend at college yet.  Anyone know how to bribe a grandma?

Bottom line is that the media is exploiting racial tensions to push a narrative. That narrative is that white people are the ruling class and blacks are the proletarian. Media wants socialism now.

Sometimes I feel like protest has lost worth here at Columbia. Most I know protest because it is "cool" or "fun", and tend to just feign anger. Protest is meaningless unless it means something to you.

I'm never gonna think the current moment I'm in will be the "best year of my life." At the age of 70 I'll still be thinking there are better years ahead of me. Appreciate the past. Embrace the future

How should I feel if my bf wants a typical threesome? I'm very territorial but I did tell him I kinda had a fantasy of 2 guys but I don't really want a threesome at all. It was just the mere thought.

Is it still called procrastination if leave things to the last minute but then never actually do them?

If you're going to announce ahead of time that you need to cut lunch short, then arrive late, just know that next time it's ok to cancel. Grumble.

In my years of college, I learned that my health is more important than my grades that would not matter in 10 years. So all people pulling an all nighter, go to sleep :)

I hate the fact that negative comments get deleted. If I read an argument, I get lost because half of them are again. Maybe yik yak should just flag them in a way YouTube does but still be viewable.

I feel as though oral sex shouldn't be given when you first have sex w someone , you don't know what they can have 😕 so like I feel that ppl should start getting tested before having sex w ppl 👀

I think the reason a lot of us that are depressed see the GWB as a potential place for suicide (we all should seek help) is that amazing view of the city being the last thing u see as a human.

Finally got a PDF to print double sided while keeping the text facing the same way on both sides of the paper. I now consider my education a success.

I wonder why Bwog hasn't shared yikyak screenshots yet. So much less effort than redacting all the facebook names ya know. (While I'm tempted to make #realreporting jokes, this is a genuine question.)

I was at NYU and their yaks sucked. I missed the Columbia yaks, my yakkers. It's good to be home again.

If you don't speak up about Ferguson, if you don't spend your time now speaking out for black lives, you are complicit, you are culpable. Black lives won't matter to America until we all speak out.

Communication is key to good relationships, cliche yes but so very important. If you are "dead" to someone don't invest energy in them. Its that simple. Take risks, ask other girls on dates. Be smart.

People of Ferguson- give em hell. When a government fails to protect natural rights, it is your duty to eliminate them. Hard to hear, but cops aren't special. Arm yourselves and fight them dirty.

Was late to my first Fight Club last night so missed the intro rules. Still, Fight Club was brilliant and I'd highly recommend Fight Club.

5 seconds of summer is a pretty horrible band name for 2 reasons. If you are talking about the season, only 5 seconds of it sucks. And if you are fucking Summer and only last 5 seconds,that sucks too.

If I've fallen for a close friend and she's interested in me as well but she doesn't want to "risk losing our friendship", is it better to pursue or give some space? Status quo is unbearable!

Truth is we put far too much value in people who do not love us. Love is selfless and sacrificial. Invest your energy in people who love to converse and be around you. Don't invest it in a black hole.
