I'm all for standing up for what you believe in. Seriously good on ya.... But walking in to the library yelling at people to put their hands up is super not cool. Def saw my life flash before my eyes.

My professor asks the class of we want to have class on Wednesday, everyone votes not to have class except one girl, because she is such a over achiever we have class now. Thanks for that dude.

Is it common in Asia to wear jeans to the gym? No judgment here, I'm the girl debating if when I leave I'm going to get pizza or dell taco, but that's all the more reason to wear spandex!!!
