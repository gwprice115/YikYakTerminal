Football rivalries seem so trivial at times like this. I can't even imagine how I would feel if this happened to anyone at Clemson. FSU, we're all behind you tonight. Prayers that everyone is okay.

Sometimes I have days where I feel like nobody likes me, and then someone goes out of their way to say something thoughtful to me and it turns my mood around. I love those people.

My girl gets so mad at me for "not talking to her" we she's the one who stops texting back. Then after 6 hours pass she gets mad but she was the one who stopped in the first place. Help.

The Ferguson protests aren't just about one case. It symbolizes much more - systemic oppression, underprivilege, profiling. It's a people issue that will only get better if we openly talk about it

I do not agree with the grand jury's decision. However, rioting is absolutely unacceptable. If you're upset, protest peacefully. Rioting makes you look barbaric. Remember what Dr. King taught us!

Making a special case for someone due to the history of their race is not political correctness. Its not payback. Its racism. Until everyone is treated the same racism will still exist.

Both white & black privilege exists.  Neither are widely institutionalized, and only occur on rare cases. The problem is not that it's really a problem, but that it's blown way out of proportion.

What sucks about this is that the rioter, looters, and arsonists aren't even from Ferguson. They were bused in from other places by Al Sharpton and other race baiters.

Everyone getting righteous over riots in Ferguson and how "this makes black people look bad" - remember, last month white people in New Hampshire rioted over pumpkins. Look it up

You want to know what racism is? If you post "it's good to be white" it's racist. If you post "it's good to be <insert any other race here>" it's perfectly fine.

I was talking to an out of stater that went to SCar and asked him why he ended up there. Said he was on a full scholarship. What he actually meant is he couldn't get into Clemson

Approaching Columbia is similar to approaching Chernobyl. Once you get close you'll start to see the effects (rotting teeth, lack of intelligent life) and once you hit it you're in danger yourself.

Bridge kids-- you're so dumb if you are going to drink in your apartment and then make a lot of noise. That's how you get caught. If you drink underage, be courteous.

Waiting for Clements to send out an email that says "Also, in light of recent events, as a school treat, all exams have been cancelled!" And then realize I still don't go to Hogwarts...

Saw Stoudt at TD's last night. Wanted to say something congratulatory but couldn't think of anything besides that interception so I just kept my mouth shut.

Well Clemson, it sucks that we lost but I had a great time and your student body is respectable. Good luck in your bowl game and cherish a QB like Deshaun Watson. He is something else.

Guys y'all always want girl to "make the first move" and I'm down to try. This may be a stupid question but what exactly should we do to make the first move?

What does a guy have to say/ask/talk about to let a girl know he's interested? You beautiful/frustrating creatures give out such complex signs that I cant tell if I even have a shot of getting laid!

every one of us is stereotyped in some way. I'm stereotyped as a girl engineer. It's all about what you make of yourself so be who you want to be and stop blaming others.

If everyone just got the fuck along, we wouldn't deal with this racism and other things. Work together instead of against each other. Stop being assholes and treat others as you would like to be.

I think we need to get the high five total to 3,517 just to make it sweeter. Or more realistically 1889 to squeeze it out against Indiana State's record.

After the civil war the north did not allow the south to effectively rebuild to healthy, prosperous states and they still suffer. It's the same case for blacks in the US and slavery.

The 911 call by Tucker's pledge brother earlier in the fall was unsettling. The tone of his voice was impatient & almost irritable. As tho placing the call was an inconvenience. Very hard to listen to

The problem is...most people don't see a problem to be fixed so they don't care. I promise they don't like having to continuously bring up racism (intentional or not)

Why the fuck do girls have to be concerned that a guy is a rapist/stalker when the main concern guys have is if she's fat?

I get being upset about something, but is the Twitter activism really necessary? What is tweeting at CNN, Fox, and Oprah going to accomplish?

It doesn't matter if something offensive is intentional or not. You still need to apologize. Also, try to make it a learning experience so everyone feels welcome in the Clemson family

Just got an email from my TA that all our grades are in. I was about to text her and ask her why she's up at 7 and then realized why the hell am I up at 7?
