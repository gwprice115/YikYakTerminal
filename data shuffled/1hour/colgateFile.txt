When mom calls to tell you she clicked the bookmark "Yellowstone Project" and found a hardcore mother-daughter threesome. She wishes me a happy birthday and implores me to confront my demons.

With the stress of finals coming up and everyone's collective bitterness lately, these protests are going to get a lot of shit

Do not ask me how I am complicit! Jesus. Racial violence is a huge problem, black lives matter and by no means am I denying that. The graffiti is a great idea. That hashtag needs to go though.

Vandalizing school property is NOT the way to make a statement. So far I've seen countless custodians forced to clean up after you. Do their lives not matter?!

Also, there's a brown bag on Ferguson tonight at 7 pm in Little Hall. I think that'll be a space everyone can speak their mind at instead of yik yak.

There might be a black-white problem in Ferguson but in LA, there is a Hispanic-White problem. This protest is way too narrow. You really shouldn't make it so exclusive by only including "Black Lives"

If you don't think the ferguson case was a good example, look at the Garner case. In no way can that decision be justified.

Please focus on the Garner case rather than Ferguson. The Garner case is much more clear cut and will serve as a better flagship example than the Ferguson case.

One of the main problems is the culture that makes harming police cool. If I was a policeman and I constantly heard rap that talked about murdering me, I would be pretty scared.

We know there is a lot of violence out there. We know there is black on white violence, we know there's black on black violence. This particular protest however is about holding police accountable

Yup, there's a lot of Black on Black crime. Black criminals are indicted and punished. Fine it's dealt with. Race aside, one problem is that a cop choked a guy to death and isn't even going to trial.

I think many agree that there should've been an indictment in the Garner (and other) cases. You don't need to protest to convince us of these injustices. Nobody is attacking you here.

You have a better shot at affecting real change if you go to class. I agree with the sentiment, but a die-in in Hamilton seems to be less effective than graduating with honors & running the world.

Can everyone please stop using the phrase "educate yourself?"  I don't know everything, but neither do you, so stop being condescending.  Maybe we just have different perspectives.

Who is this protesting even directed towards? Seems to me like an excuse to get all riled up and blame white folk for issues they have no control over and honestly issues they also view as unjust.

Defacing the flag is basically spitting in the face of the men and women WHO GAVE THEIR LIVES to provide you with the right to freedom of speech. You can protest but don't disrespect the flag.

Most students sympathize with feeling isolated on campus. We all have at some point. Nobody sympathizes with being called a murderer or with the desecration of our campus.

Just so you know- hanging the American flag upside down is an internationally recognized signal of extreme danger. How dare you disrespect something so simple yet so meaningful with this protest.

If you don't like the way our country's established justice system works and think defacing the symbol of our country is the way to symbolize that you can kindly get the fuck out of this country.

I've been split on the ACC for some time. I largely agree with many of their sentiments, and while their language can be hostile or exclusive, they seemed to mean well. I can't reconcile this, though.

Honestly people would have respected the die-in f it wasn't the ACC running it. Some of the worst people I've met are part of the ACC and it has nothing to do with their race.

You can call me privileged, complicit, fuck it, call me a racist even though I'm not. But I'm an American until the day I die. Fuck you ACC. You don't deserve the freedoms you enjoy.

Plot twist: I can care about racism AND think that the ACC'S treatment of the flag is abhorrent.

You guys realize the ACC blatantly lied in their fliers. Now I know reading and writing is hard for them especially when it comes to the facts but well cut em some slack here.

I hate the arrogant and accusatory attitude of the ACC but there are much more serious "crimes" going on at this school than destroying a flag. Sexual assault, for example.

"Defacing a flag is a misdemeanor" well underage drinking is illegal too but that didn't stop you. You defend the law only when it suits you

If you think the flag should be burned, you are ignorant and you should educate yourself (been wanting to use that one for a while now).

In what world does defacing school property forward a message about police brutality? And who thinks defacing a flag that represents those who fought to give you freedom to speak helps your message?

Trying to take a cops weapon is a great way to get shot. Flying a desecrated American flag is a great way to end up in jail. I hope you end up there, where you belong.

People should hang their flags in the coop tomorrow and then have another die in. So it's like showing solidarity with what's going on in ferguson w.out disrespecting what people have worked to build

I know most of the kids protesting are probably sociology majors, but if someone says they can't breathe that should be a sign that they actually CAN breathe.

I'm torn. I am a minority and I DO believe in equality and justice. I am open-minded. I want my voice to be heard. I want CHANGE. But I need to keep it in perspective and I'm so conflicted.

Men and women give their lives every day to protect what that flag symbolizes. How dare you desecrate the flag and delegitimize their sacrifice. You are a disgrace to this school and this country.

Acc kids clearly didn't exactly learn the whole "use your words" lesson in kindergarten. Protip: rants don't work. Calmly explaining where you're coming from does. I support the cause but not method.

If the ACC is making a moment of silence happen during dancefest it should not only be for lives lost due to racially charged violence but for the soldiers disrespected by their defacing of the flag.

My dad is a vet. As are my brother and uncle. What they fought for was a flag that stands for freedom and equality.  I presume that #acc is making the point that the ideals are not being met. Vailid.

So let me get this straight, you are outraged at the fact that someone wrote on the flag and hung it upside down but it's okay to wear the flag on your shirt to a frat party and spill beer on it.

Y'all have problems with anything. "ACC caused them to close the balcony. *balcony opens* "Okay but that wasn't soon enough"

The racism that's part of our country stems from the gov't and media. We, as a nation, need to start paying attention to whom we give power in general. If we do that, a lot of problems will disappear.

Genuine question-what is the acc trying to accomplish? I support their cause but not their methods, and I feel like most of the campus agrees-- we want equality but how will what these protests help?

Desecrating the American flag is a sign of distress. A society in which some citizens believe their lives matter more than others is deeply distressed. So is one in which citizens don't care. -a prof

I'll send my email during Dancefest so people won't realize I think desecration of the flag is a "respectful disturbance." Oh! And I can try to delegitimize "debate" by putting it in quotes!

In order to save something dear wars are waged.As long as there is love, there will be hate. And some will take advantage of that hatred. The monster known as hate will not die.it will birth more pain

Plot twist: girls and guys can be friends without wanting to fuck each other, but that doesn't mean they can't be friends if the sexual tension is there also. Just live in the moment.

Our flag doesn't just represent soldiers. It represents the whole country. Things good and bad. Bringing attention to injustice in our country is actually honoring those who fought to have that right.

Soldiers fight so everyone in this country can be free and equal. They don't fight so no one writes on the flag. It's not cool to disrespect the flag but soldiers would respect pointing out injustice

Why can't we all agree that "defacing" a flag is not worth taking someone's life? Like why is that so hard to agree on? Basic human rights people.

As much as we may dislike Herbst, he said something very accurate: "The present debate over the use of the flag has superseded the main issue of respect for human life." Let's all keep this in mind.

I feel badly about how hurtful people are acting in response to the ACC, but if its members would appeal with reason and rationality, instead of anger, then they would be a lot more successful
