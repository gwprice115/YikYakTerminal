I like the south, don't get me wrong. I respect you people. But the truth of the matter is that you live in a fantasy down here. A detached reality. If you came to the north for a while, you'd see.

You aren't trying to get married right out of college cause you have no reason to. You have a few more years to get more out of life before you switch gears.

Having a boyfriend during finals would be cool because you could just have sex to relieve some stress but I'd probably be too stressed to do anything but fuck. So maybe that isn't such a great plan.

Can the bully decide what is and isn't offensive to the one being bullied? Can the racist say what is and isn't racist? One side needs more respect, the other needs thicker skin.

Could someone please make a book of what is offensive and what isn't so I don't offend anyone? It's really hard in this day and age.

It doesn't matter if something offensive is intentional or not. You still need to apologize. Also, try to make it a learning experience so everyone feels welcome in the Clemson family

This will get down voted immediately, but "ClemsonCripmas" is why people hate Greek life. Ashamed share these beautiful hills with whoever thought this shit was ok.

Just got an email from my TA that all our grades are in. I was about to text her and ask her why she's up at 7 and then realized why the hell am I up at 7?
