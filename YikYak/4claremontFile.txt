I really don't see any reason to argue for the admission of someone who doesn't identify as female into an all women's college. For trans women, it makes all of the sense, but beyond that no.

College is a vicious cycle: you spend time cramming the entire week to make up for the time you wasted being hungover only to go and get smashed again to make up for the hellish week.

I don't like the premise of hook ups in college cause it's all about power and relieving yourself from your academic stresses. Have sex because of humanness, people. Not your stressed out existence.

I know who I am when I'm alone, I'm something else when I see you. You don't understand, you should never know, how easy you are to need

It's tougher to find a loyal friend who truly loves you, than it is to find a boyfriend. Not in this college, but in the world. I love my friends, they always help me get up.

When your family asks why you don't have a significant other over break just give them an in depth description of the 5C hookup culture and how you have participated. That should shut them up.

Please be aware of your anti-Semitic values. It's one thing to openly embrace them and admit to your oppressiveness. It's another to call yourself liberal.

If you ever fuck up something and need to apologize, do not rationalize it.  Apologize, take responsibility and move on.  Rationalizing this will only make the situation worse.

"But not all white people are racist! White lives matter too!" Everyone already knows that. That's not the point. White people don't need defending when the whole damn system stands behind them.

Regardless of what you believe the presented "facts" suggest, it should be inherently disturbing that our justice system doesn't believe that the murder of an unarmed 18 yr old merits a trial.

Why can't the 5Cs take a few damn days off of our month long winter break so that we can have a full week off for Thanksgiving?

As a minority is Claremont, I have mixed feelings about the march. I know that there are a lot of white people here who want to speak out, but part of me thinks it's preaching to the choir.
