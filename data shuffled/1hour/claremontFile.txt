Sometimes I actually like to talk to girls before we hookup. Sometimes I like to fuck girls senseless without saying much. Do you prefer one over the other?

S/O to the girl playing with poi balls on Scripps lawn. Every moment of college there should be something awesome in sight, and you're the first I've seen in a while.

Why was my mom's first question when I told her I threw up and haven't been feeling well to ask if I'm pregnant? I miss the days when she would say "poor baby" instead of "is it a baby?"

I blame Christianity for making me feel guilty whenever I have sex. Not that it stops me from doing it, but it would've been nice to grow up with more sex positivity

I don't like the premise of hook ups in college cause it's all about power and relieving yourself from your academic stresses. Have sex because of humanness, people. Not your stressed out existence.

Girls, if you need to use the men's room, just come in, piss, and get out. No need to sonar check for guys by screaming.

When your family asks why you don't have a significant other over break just give them an in depth description of the 5C hookup culture and how you have participated. That should shut them up.

When life gives you lemons, throw them back in its face because life needs to learn that if it's gonna fuck with you, you're gonna fight back.

All the people who say judgmental shit about CMC and our lives here should worry about yourself. Maybe try getting to know us, and how happy we are, before crossing judgement.

At Pitzer, the excuse for not washing your hands after you pee is because it's a waste of water. At CMC, it's because time is money. At Pomona, it's because we don't piss on our hands.

Does anyone else attempt to make the face of the emoji they're considering using in a text just to make sure it's an accurate representation of the expression/emotion/message you want to convey?

If you ever fuck up something and need to apologize, do not rationalize it.  Apologize, take responsibility and move on.  Rationalizing this will only make the situation worse.

Fact of the night: grand juries refuse an indictment in only 11 of 126,000 cases. Except when a police officer is involved. Then they're refused 80 out of 81 times.

There seems to be a troll (or a few of them) just feeding off the yaks about what happened today. It's truly disgusting that they find it amusing to make fun of such a painful tragedy.

We need to judge these things on a case-by-case basis. Just because many police officers have committed horrible racist acts doesn't make this individual officer guilty of murder.

I am so disappointed in the people who go to this school who are not outraged by the events in Ferguson. I don't think I can talk to you if you support the grand jury decision.

I'll put it this way: I wasn't on that jury and I don't know all the evidence that was presented. So I don't think I have a right to say what happened and what didn't. What I can say is shit's fucked

Comparing tragedies is a disgusting thing to do. Whether it's 1 life or 100, it's too much. Both are grand injustices but exist on a different axis of oppression. Stop using one to minimize the other

As a minority is Claremont, I have mixed feelings about the march. I know that there are a lot of white people here who want to speak out, but part of me thinks it's preaching to the choir.

It's crazy that people can't even say they're are uncertain/confused without being down voted. So much for discussions and tolerance

I wonder how long all these protests will last. Do they ever actually cause a significant change, or just make people feel like they're doing their part?

I'm a poc who grew up with non-pocs my entire life. I've never considered myself a particularly racially conscious person. Ferguson changed this. How is it that in my 20 years I've never seen justice?

Protests do mean something. They make a change whether people believe it or not. It's an idea that spreads out to others, supplying people with knowledge of what others believe in.

If the protests do work that will show how flawed our justice system is. Do we really want a court system that is so easily influenced by public opinion which can sometimes be very uneducated?

This is about the criminalization of black bodies. We incarcerate a higher % of black people today than South Africa did under apartheid.

You know why they're called the holidays? Because you need to work the rest of the year to take off the weight you put on. If we had no vacation, life would be one big vacation.

Jackfernandesfitness here just reminding everyone to have a great thanksgiving! Stay away from the stuffing though. Empty calories are the quickest way to lose that fit physique! #fernandesdailytips

Ok Claremont, help me. I'm really sick and I think I need to see a doctor soon. SHS/clinics in village don't seem to open till Monday, but I don't think I can wait that long. What do I do.

I've been at the gym for five minutes when a bacon mania food truck just rolls up outside followed by a crepe one and a lobster one. This is why I don't work out.

Woke up. Went to my first class. Skipped the second one. Ate. And now I'm about to sleep because I'm super stressed out and sleep deprived. Self care comes first.

It's always awkward ending conversations with loved ones.  I always say "I love you" and they're like,"thank you for choosing domino's"

Instead of doing homework or anything else productive I am looking at an elaborate mac and cheese pizza recipe. I promise I attend a top-ranked institution.

Do we really need to down vote yaks where discussions are trying to be had? Even if it is an unpopular opinion at least we can see the conversation flow and see people's thought processes.

I've gotten in the habit recently of just changing into pajamas after my last class of the day and then just working until I fall asleep. Makes life a little fuzzier even if it's sad

I personally put a lot of value on eating right, being in shape, and maintaing a healthy body weight. I don't think it's "biased" or "fat shaming" to look for the same values someone I'd date

Most of the time when you're crying nobody notices your tears. When you're worried, nobody feels your pain. When you're happy, nobody sees your smile. But when you fart just that one time in public...

Spotted: jackfernandesfitness leaving block with two girls making out together. Wonder what that threesome looked like, and if it involved protein shakes of any kind.

What do you want, snake? You tear apart my friend's heart, then you try to steal my other friend's date. Watch your actions. Mess with another friend's feelings, and you will be publicly called out.

When you write papers, post the prompt as the header or footer so you can continually check if you're addressing all the points of your thesis. You're welcome juniors

I wish that everyone had good self image and confidence. Partly because it makes everyone so much more happy and attractive, but also I'm tired of telling my friends they aren't ugly or fat or lame.
