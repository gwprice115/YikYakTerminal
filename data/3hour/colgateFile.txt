Girls need to understand that we invite you to have a good time. Dance, drink, laugh, but don't come just to take our alcohol then leave... That's just as shallow as a guy just out for sex....

I hate working against the "clingy girl" stereotype. No, I haven't gotten too attached. No, I don't want to get married in 5 seconds. Calm yo self bro, I'm just flirting with you.

Take a moment to take a deep breath. In just a few weeks it will be break. I hope the weeks to come are as low-stress as possible for you! Please remember if it gets to be too much you are not alone.

I hate no one else but myself for not trying to be with you. I only have eyes for you but I can't seem to hold a long conversation with you or make you laugh like other guys do. I am mad at myself

Is there someone precious to you? When people have someone precious to them that they want to protect, that is when they can truly become strong. You will become strong too one day

When mom calls to tell you she clicked the bookmark "Yellowstone Project" and found a hardcore mother-daughter threesome. She wishes me a happy birthday and implores me to confront my demons.

I think the best feature of Google docs is that you don't have to constantly save your work,  so you're less likely to get fucked over by your computer crashing

I hope you realize that the flag you defaced is the reason that you can protest in this country and not be shot for doing so. America guarantees a lot of freedoms denied elsewhere, keep that in mind.

The fact that people have to say "I'm black and I also don't support the ACC" clearly shows that the ACC is doing something wrong in terms of perpetuating equality.

Regardless of the legal implications of the defacing of the flag, if there even are any, that sort of vandalism is disrespectful and unnecessary and those responsible should face serious repercussions

Liberals are the least tolerant people. They support freedom of speech until you disagree with them. If your opinion is different it's automatically written off as wrong

I'm appalled by the lack of justice for Garner, Brown, and countless others. I supported the sit-in & die-in.I support my people, which I believe is all people.But don't desecrate what people die for.

In what world does defacing school property forward a message about police brutality? And who thinks defacing a flag that represents those who fought to give you freedom to speak helps your message?

I'm torn. I am a minority and I DO believe in equality and justice. I am open-minded. I want my voice to be heard. I want CHANGE. But I need to keep it in perspective and I'm so conflicted.

Men and women give their lives every day to protect what that flag symbolizes. How dare you desecrate the flag and delegitimize their sacrifice. You are a disgrace to this school and this country.

Acc kids clearly didn't exactly learn the whole "use your words" lesson in kindergarten. Protip: rants don't work. Calmly explaining where you're coming from does. I support the cause but not method.

If the ACC is making a moment of silence happen during dancefest it should not only be for lives lost due to racially charged violence but for the soldiers disrespected by their defacing of the flag.

The two girls walking around with the flags absolutely disgust me. What could possibly make you think that is a good idea.

My dad is a vet. As are my brother and uncle. What they fought for was a flag that stands for freedom and equality.  I presume that #acc is making the point that the ideals are not being met. Vailid.

So let me get this straight, you are outraged at the fact that someone wrote on the flag and hung it upside down but it's okay to wear the flag on your shirt to a frat party and spill beer on it.

Are they taking up 2/5 of the chapel on purpose? Only 3/5 of us get to sit.

You either support the cause or you don't. Truly that simple. I am not referring to the ACC. Obviously the cause exists beyond the ACC.

The racism that's part of our country stems from the gov't and media. We, as a nation, need to start paying attention to whom we give power in general. If we do that, a lot of problems will disappear.

The ACC is complete embarrassment without FSU. FSU just will not and can not lose.

Genuine question-what is the acc trying to accomplish? I support their cause but not their methods, and I feel like most of the campus agrees-- we want equality but how will what these protests help?

🇺🇸 stands for the lives of my brother, grandfather, and the tens of thousands of other men and women who shed their blood for this nation. It is not just  a piece of cloth.

I'll send my email during Dancefest so people won't realize I think desecration of the flag is a "respectful disturbance." Oh! And I can try to delegitimize "debate" by putting it in quotes!

Our flag doesn't just represent soldiers. It represents the whole country. Things good and bad. Bringing attention to injustice in our country is actually honoring those who fought to have that right.

I feel bad for the tour guides that have to explain why "fuck your privileges" is written on the coop steps. Makes me sad that people are going to get the wrong impression of Colgate.

The double standard here is ridiculous. The entire ACC movement has not helped with school interaction. I am actually more nervous confronting minorities because I think the assume I'm a bigot as well

To promote equality. Everyone will get the same grades on finals. For example those who get an A will have their grade lowered to a B so those who get C's dont feel bad. #equality

The flag is so valued to me and many others because the blood of my brothers and comrades are sewn into its fabric. When you desecrate it you desecrate the memory of those who gave up so much for you.

As much as we may dislike Herbst, he said something very accurate: "The present debate over the use of the flag has superseded the main issue of respect for human life." Let's all keep this in mind.
