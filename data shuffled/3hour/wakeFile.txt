Walked into the pit last week, slipped and fell on my ass, nobody saw but one guy, he stared up at me from his meal, and said "It'll be our secret". Love you bro, love you

We need to take the UVA case as a learning example. Women shouldn't be scared to report to sexual assault.  Men shouldn't take advantage of (inebriated) women. Stand as one with UVA.

Regardless of your opinion about certain campus issues, tonight's town hall underscores exactly why I love this school: at the end of the day, we're a community. And we know we can be better. Go deacs

Although nothing as bad as Phipsi happens here please keep in mind that at almost every party guys and also girls take advantage of those who are too drunk. If you see this, step in and say something

DATING TIP: hold the door for your date. Rip the door off its hinges. Use the door as a weapon to fight off other men. Establish dominance.

Coming from a minority student, I think the chalkers are upset at their own faults so they try to blame others. I have rarely seen any racism on this campus.

In light of recent tragedies on college campuses, pick one Wake student in your first class today and make a decision to look out for him or her at parties or around campus.

How bout wait til they release all the evidence that was given to the grand jury, then decide whether or not you agree with their decision. The whole issue is that everybody jumps to conclusions.

Both extremes are wrong. Both men were at fault. It's an unfortunate situation. No one was completely in the right. Both sides, shut the fuck up.

It wasn't a hate crime, but time and time again black men are punished more severely than white men for the same crime. The actions weren't necessarily unjustified, but the severity was uncalled for.

The only thing keeping me motivated to work right now is the fact that I'll be cuddling my dog in 16 hours.

If someone presents an opposing argument that you believe is wrong, the best thing you can do is argue back with facts, not with judgment or insults or rage. It devalues your point. Thanks!

I'd take a big butt over big boobs any day of the week. There's soo many more fun things you could do with an ass than you can with tits.

"Mom do you need any help?" "No, but thanks for asking!" "You're welcome. It was the last I could do!" But really... it was the very least I could do.

If you're lonely on campus tonight/over the next few days, do some online Christmas shopping. Finding gifts and thinking about my family and friends back home makes me feel better.

I've never been more embarrassed as a deacon. What was done to Imam Griggs is disgusting and disgraceful. Leave the man some flowers

when people combat issues that don't affect them by yelling "stop talking about it!!!!" it really shows their selfishness.

"What is sacred? Of what is the spirit made? What is worth living for, and what is worth dying for? The answer to each is the same: only love." Let's try to spread love not hate! Go deacs!

I'm actually very freaked out. While I was jacking off, Pandora played an ad for a sperm bank that started with a lady saying she knew what I was doing....🗿

If I sent my dad a letter about dropping out of school and coming home, he would probably just correct it and send it back to me.
