The problem with us girls masturbating is that since we can orgasm multiple times in a row, it becomes a vicious cycle of pleasure. It could go one forever.

The word racist is used to easily. There's a lot of things I can't stand about "most" white people. That doesn't make me racist. There's a lot of stuff I can't stand about black ppl either.

Approaching Columbia is similar to approaching Chernobyl. Once you get close you'll start to see the effects (rotting teeth, lack of intelligent life) and once you hit it you're in danger yourself.

What does a guy have to say/ask/talk about to let a girl know he's interested? You beautiful/frustrating creatures give out such complex signs that I cant tell if I even have a shot of getting laid!

I think we need to get the high five total to 3,517 just to make it sweeter. Or more realistically 1889 to squeeze it out against Indiana State's record.

This homeless guy asked me for money the other day. I was about to give it to him and then I thought he was going to use it on drugs or alcohol. And then I thought, that's what I'm going to use it on

The most ups I've ever seen on a Yak here at Clemson is like 200. So jump that number to 600, & then say there's 21,303 students at Clemson. Thus, at worst Yik Yak represents 2.9% of the student body

You want to know what racism is? If you post "it's good to be white" it's racist. If you post "it's good to be <insert any other race here>" it's perfectly fine.

A SCar top yak: "if Columbia is the armpit of the state then Clemson is the butt because only shit comes out of there." Wow. That was a really really good one. You sure showed us. Best rival yak ever.

I shouldn't have to hate being black right now... And Yik Yak is almost making me feel that way. Why can't we just love? I love white people I love my fellow black people. I'm so sad right now.

Some days I consider switching my major to English just to avoid calculus. Then I remember research papers are just as annoying, AND I would lose scholarship money.

Everything you do is in some way for yourself. No matter how selfless and act may seem it's still selfish at its roots even if it's just because you're doing it to feel good or avoid guilt.

I disagree when people say that once you leave school and are in the working world, you'll want to go back to school. I worked 60 hours a week this summer and honestly liked it better than school.

Making a special case for someone due to the history of their race is not political correctness. Its not payback. Its racism. Until everyone is treated the same racism will still exist.

I do not agree with the grand jury's decision. However, rioting is absolutely unacceptable. If you're upset, protest peacefully. Rioting makes you look barbaric. Remember what Dr. King taught us!

I overheard some Gamecocks before the game saying all they cared about was getting 6.  They must have been really excited to get 17!

Well Clemson, it sucks that we lost but I had a great time and your student body is respectable. Good luck in your bowl game and cherish a QB like Deshaun Watson. He is something else.
