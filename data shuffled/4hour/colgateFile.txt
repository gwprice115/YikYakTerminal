To whoever is preaching the "thin skin" BS: nothing says you have a thinner skin than anonymously targeting people on Yik Yak. You clearly can't handle taking public responsibility for your thoughts.

While I don't have all the facts and even if the ACC made an error in judgement today, that doesn't mean that anyone should trivialize their cause. Racism is still an issue. Let's not forget that.

If you think the flag should be burned, you are ignorant and you should educate yourself (been wanting to use that one for a while now).

If you think America is doing such a terrible job, don't burn its flag and throw off everything it stands for, either work to fix it or go somewhere that will be up to your standards

What if the ACC/Colgate arranged some kind of a panel or discussion to start an actual campus conversation? I feel like we have find some way to create positive change here...isn't that the goal?

Not all minority students are part of the acc. Please don't judge us all for their ignorant and disrespectful actions. Calm discourse solves problems. Disrespecting what people die for daily, doesn't.

The racism that's part of our country stems from the gov't and media. We, as a nation, need to start paying attention to whom we give power in general. If we do that, a lot of problems will disappear.

Our flag doesn't just represent soldiers. It represents the whole country. Things good and bad. Bringing attention to injustice in our country is actually honoring those who fought to have that right.

Soldiers fight so everyone in this country can be free and equal. They don't fight so no one writes on the flag. It's not cool to disrespect the flag but soldiers would respect pointing out injustice

So many people on this campus are being extremely emotional ans way too abstract in their thinking. If your life is shitty and people on this campus cause it than let's figure out a way to stop it.

Bought a beautiful steak last night. I took her home, gave her a nice rub and put her in heat. I slept with her then ate her. Best night of my life.

To promote equality. Everyone will get the same grades on finals. For example those who get an A will have their grade lowered to a B so those who get C's dont feel bad. #equality

The flag is so valued to me and many others because the blood of my brothers and comrades are sewn into its fabric. When you desecrate it you desecrate the memory of those who gave up so much for you.

The ACC has great intentions. They are protesting in the same way as people across the country. Stop being ignorant, take the time to think about what they stand for. Be aware of the world u live in

As much as we may dislike Herbst, he said something very accurate: "The present debate over the use of the flag has superseded the main issue of respect for human life." Let's all keep this in mind.

I feel badly about how hurtful people are acting in response to the ACC, but if its members would appeal with reason and rationality, instead of anger, then they would be a lot more successful
