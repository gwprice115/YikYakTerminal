I may not like the ACC, but I gotta say mad respect for how they are so confident in stating their opinions. The rest of us just seem to be hiding behind yik-yak

Well guess what if you don't agree with 100% of what the acc does you're surely ignorant and need to be yelled at by some self entitled prick

Now when people look back at the protest, they won't think of the good it did, they'll only remember the desecration of our nations flag.

This break is longer so west coast students can go back home for the holiday too. And the irony is that I still can't afford to go back.

While I don't have all the facts and even if the ACC made an error in judgement today, that doesn't mean that anyone should trivialize their cause. Racism is still an issue. Let's not forget that.

The reason why everything is happening is really unfortunate, but as a military brat I'm loving the patriotism on here. I'm proud to be an American and glad others feel the same!🇺🇸 #thankyoudad

Trying to take a cops weapon is a great way to get shot. Flying a desecrated American flag is a great way to end up in jail. I hope you end up there, where you belong.

If I know who defaced the flag, what would be a good way to share that name around campus, and would that be petty or justified?

Just talked to the coop staff and was told that they are gonna end up cleaning up all the windows. I don't care about you protest ACC but have the decency to wipe your own ass when you are done.

I hope you realize that the flag you defaced is the reason that you can protest in this country and not be shot for doing so. America guarantees a lot of freedoms denied elsewhere, keep that in mind.

How ignorant and contemptuous can someone be to not only wave a defaced, upside down American flag around campus, but to also make it her profile picture... I'm embarrassed to say I go here

I may be a pretty ordinary college leftist who has a lot of criticism regarding the US, but God damn if I don't love this country to it's core. Respect what we have and everyone who makes it possible.

Our flag is a symbol of American ideals--freedom, opportunity and equality. Granted, the United States does not always live up to these ideals. Yet defacing the symbol does not improve our country.
