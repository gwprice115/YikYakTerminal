We need to take the UVA case as a learning example. Women shouldn't be scared to report to sexual assault.  Men shouldn't take advantage of (inebriated) women. Stand as one with UVA.

I have never seen such a look of anger and betrayal as when I walked in the Pit at 9:50 and asked for an omelette.

When my dad was my age he had 4 kids and a mortgage. I just got upset because my ice cream didn't have enough chocolate chips in it.

All you freshman are gonna be disappointed by pitsgiving after all this yik yak hype.  Is it better than any other day at the pit?  Yes.  Will it even come close to your mom's cooking?  Hopefully not.

The best part about hitting 10,000 Yakarma is gaining access to the phone line where British computer voices read you popular yaks. Keyword: British.

That was the most fight I've seen this football team put up. We're proud as hell of you. And weaver, you came through for all of us after all. All is forgiven.

Apparently UNC football players spray painted "UNC" all over Duke's locker room after their win Saturday. But to be honest I'm just surprised their football players know that many letters.

How bout wait til they release all the evidence that was given to the grand jury, then decide whether or not you agree with their decision. The whole issue is that everybody jumps to conclusions.

Regarding ferguson, I can honestly say that none of your opinions matter because you haven't looked over all of the evidence and the jury reports.

It wasn't a hate crime, but time and time again black men are punished more severely than white men for the same crime. The actions weren't necessarily unjustified, but the severity was uncalled for.

Hatch, the reason why people threw toilet paper into the trees is because we won a fucking basketball game. It probably had nothing to do with Ferguson, you idiot.

People need to trust that the grand jury made the right call. They had the evidence and an international spotlight that kept them in line. We, on the other hand, have no evidence.

Don't leave your dorm if it lost power. The card readers aren't working to let you back in. Trust me, I'm locked out of my building.

My fellow Deacs, I know our basketball team isn't the best it's ever been and it's hell week for students, but they need our support to build a program.  And we're on ESPN.  Go to games.

But really, why are we not talking more about the problems that LGBT students face when a national publications publicly shames our University as the sixth worst school for LGBT persons.

People who are talking about everything Forward Together isn't doing are only doing it to crap all over what they have been doing. They're using the other minority groups as props to discredit them.

Just remember this: You got into this school because Wake Forest saw something in you. They believe you are intelligent enough to succeed. Stop believing otherwise, study hard and rock it.
