I feel inferior to my friends and dorm mates because I'm from a poor family and have parents who didn't go to college like theirs and haven't even left the US before. I don't belong here.

Stop blindly supporting Ferguson. Stop supporting riots. Stop hating on police officers who are doing their jobs. Start protesting.

Debating on whether or not to get out of bed. So much work. So much more time to procrastinate.

Rather than dealing with crowds, why not just do online shopping? It's safer.

I'm not sure why people are fine with being so excited for thanksgiving. It's a holiday that celebrates a short lived peace ("have some cranberries") before the native Americans were fked. No thanks.

How to best spend your Thanksgiving break:1.sleeping, 2.eating, 3. masturbating, 4. catching up with your favorite tv shows, 5. facebook stalking beautiful people while pretending to study.

No matter what side you are on concerning Ferguson, we can all agree the police need body cameras to prevent speculation and confusion. If Wilson had a camera, this would have been over day one.

Damn some of you are straight up racist about the protest. It's amazing what anonymity does to a person.

More people would be supporting this movement to end discrimination if people had chosen a case that actually had to do with racism

What's the line between 'social justice warrior' and 'activist'?  Was Dr. King a 'sjw', and if not, what do sjw's do different than activists to garner criticism?

Why the fuck would Chegg acquire courserank and then take it down. Don't they know courserank was a 100x better product than anything they've ever made. And the founders suck for being aqua hired.

I'm a Republican and #ICantBreathe. It is ridiculous and completely immoral that we as a country still let this happen. Republicans and Democrats equally should move for a change cause it's necessary.

Honestly,  I don't want to talk about your startup or perfect GPA or even ISIS at the table.  I'd prefer a conversation about other things.  Like the weather, or a movie,  anything else really.

In light of recent posts, if you're feeling hopeless or at all suicidal please seek out a friend, or call the bridge or CAPS. #'s are listed on their websites. Someone is always available to listen.

Stanford's a really difficult place. Anti-depressants have helped me a lot, but I'm still taking some time off soon. Don't be afraid to try different, seemingly extreme things.

Whether you got a B or a B+ in that one class, a C or a C+ in another class, it doesn't really matter in the scheme of things. Work hard, but don't overwork yourself. You go to Stanford after all!
