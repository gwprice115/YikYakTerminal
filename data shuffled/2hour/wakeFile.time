I've accepted my fate. I've stopped studying and I'm writing my final will right now in preparation for my immediate death tomorrow.

Kids are fun, but since when did your campus become the local park? Every weekend I see so many moms and kids here

Trying to convince a cop that you are sober by preemptively shouting the abc's backward will do little to convince said cop of your sobriety. Also tomorrow is finals, it is ok to be sober this week
