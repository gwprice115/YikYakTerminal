The Ferguson protests aren't just about one case. It symbolizes much more - systemic oppression, underprivilege, profiling. It's a people issue that will only get better if we openly talk about it

I do not agree with the grand jury's decision. However, rioting is absolutely unacceptable. If you're upset, protest peacefully. Rioting makes you look barbaric. Remember what Dr. King taught us!

Both white & black privilege exists.  Neither are widely institutionalized, and only occur on rare cases. The problem is not that it's really a problem, but that it's blown way out of proportion.

Being "color-blind" is not the solution. We have to embrace all cultures, races, and backgrounds, not pretend that differences don't exist.

Shut up about the Ferguson case. None of us were there. None of us saw it. It is POINTLESS to argue an opinion based off of the media coverage. Can we please just stop. Please! It is not our fight!

To those preaching about black stereotypes, look up the 2011 England riots. A young man was shot to death by a police officer. Both white and the white community rioted and looted the same way

You want to know what racism is? If you post "it's good to be white" it's racist. If you post "it's good to be <insert any other race here>" it's perfectly fine.

I want to date the girl at Clemson who *isn't* wearing black leggings with brown boots and a north face jacket. Oh wait, that's none of them.

Approaching Columbia is similar to approaching Chernobyl. Once you get close you'll start to see the effects (rotting teeth, lack of intelligent life) and once you hit it you're in danger yourself.

If you want to skip the lines go to backstreets or OT. They're still busy but it's not as overcrowded as the rest. No cover either.

To put it in perspective how bad South Carolina's defense was. Dylan Thompson broke the season passing yardage record for USC and they still lost six games.

Michael Brown case is too ambiguous to really get specifically upset about, but the Eric Garner case is pretty clearly messed up, and I would love to see someone give an actual argument against that

As a white girl from the south,racism is growing out bc that's all older people know & it will die eventually. You can't blame a whole race based on the few. That's the literal definition of racism.

Weakness is what brings ignorance, cheapness, racism, homophobia, desperation, cruelty, brutality, all these things that will keep a society chained to the ground, with one foot nailed to the floor.

The word racist is used to easily. There's a lot of things I can't stand about "most" white people. That doesn't make me racist. There's a lot of stuff I can't stand about black ppl either.

Let's face it blacks are the problem. Our crime rate is 5times that of the whites at 1/5th the population. To end racism we need to better ourselves and our community as a whole.

I disagree when people say that once you leave school and are in the working world, you'll want to go back to school. I worked 60 hours a week this summer and honestly liked it better than school.

I like the south, don't get me wrong. I respect you people. But the truth of the matter is that you live in a fantasy down here. A detached reality. If you came to the north for a while, you'd see.

You aren't trying to get married right out of college cause you have no reason to. You have a few more years to get more out of life before you switch gears.

Why the fuck do girls have to be concerned that a guy is a rapist/stalker when the main concern guys have is if she's fat?

I get being upset about something, but is the Twitter activism really necessary? What is tweeting at CNN, Fox, and Oprah going to accomplish?

It doesn't matter if something offensive is intentional or not. You still need to apologize. Also, try to make it a learning experience so everyone feels welcome in the Clemson family
