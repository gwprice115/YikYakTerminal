To prepare for Mark's anatomy exam, I went to the strip club. One of the strippers jiggled her boobs and quizzed me on it's musculature. To my surprise, she also took anatomy not too long ago.

If we want true equality in our language we must stop the use of ableism. Saying someone is "blind"or"deaf" to facts, "crippling" a foe, or is"crazy"to do that. The disabled are people, not metaphors.

Why is it so hard for ppl to just say "no"? Idc that you don't want to go out with me, don't sit here and make up bs excuses or  ignore me until it goes away. A simple "no" and we can all move on.

So when I see a cute girl do I a) try to make eye contact and smile. b) compliment you on your cool hat/boots etc. c) go straight up and say you're really cute, hi my name is _. d) Hi what's your name

Sat in the car with roommate for 5 minutes in silence, deciding long and hard whether or not to go to class once we got to campus. The struggle is real.

So there is a new app like Tindr called "the grade". Your profile can get an F, and if you do the app actually kicks you off and you can't use it. No more dick pic creepers or bitchy girls! 👌

Always swipe right on tinder it gives you options and you'll never accidentally swipe left to someone you wanted to swipe right too. If you get a match you don't like just don't message the person.

My boyfriend refuses to brush his teeth. You can literally see the yellow nasty plaque on his teeth. I'm getting so grossed out I won't even kiss him. He doesn't seem to notice.

Tonight I will be going to the liquor store to select the type of alcohol I will be drinking alone on Thanksgiving, since my family lives thousands of miles away.

Was approached by a man at brunch asking me if I was trying to seduce him because of the way I was eating my crepe. I'm sorry I use my tongue to lick my spoon clean. Also, fuck no.

Guys who date you just to have sex with you then dump you after a month are pieces of shit and deserve to get their dick privileges taken away from them.

What's the best way to display your displeasure and anger at injustice? Obviously, rioting and destroying shit mindlessly is the answer. Come on people, MLK is rolling in his grave.

This whole situation is sad and terrifying. The people of Ferguson will be in my thoughts tonight. He deserved justice.

To the people who are getting upset because we bring up Ferguson on here instead of "doing something about it," we're doing 10x more than those who are keeping their mouths shut.

White people on here need to stop being so butthurt. This isn't about us. This is about the injustice and brutality black people face in the US.

No one seems to understand what a grand jury is. They weren't deciding his guilt, they were deciding whether there was probable cause for a full trial. There was probable cause. Riots justified.

Do not become consumed in the small scope of race. Ferguson is only one small incident of a larger injustice that has NOTHING to do with race. Don't let them divide and conquer us.

This is why we need body cameras. Only cops with something to hide would be against them bc they would protect both the people AND any officer accused of anything.

I'm sure those of you who are so strongly opposed to the grand jury's decision will not take the time to read the jury notes so you can actually formulate your own opinion based on what was presented

Before you say anything about Ferguson. Go read the jury notes. The New York Times has released them and I'm sure many other publications have as well.

Pro tip: Bikers stop carrying your bikes up and down legacy bridge stairs. There are rails on the edges of the steps to let you roll it up and down with ease. You'll be surprised you didn't notice!

If I got called a cracker nobody would do anything and it would be seen as funny. You call a black person a derogatory term and you're a racist

I can't masturbate because one hand has a broken finger and a large splint with gauze underneath. And the other is in pain from a tetanus shot. Help 😔

Sometimes I wish I could just pause time, walk/drive around, contemplate life, enjoy just some time with myself, and clean my room. Then life can resume.

I'm not sure what my grade is. Hopefully it's a B, but it's most likely a C but it actually might be a D. I actually have no idea what my grade is

Waiting for someone to fall in the back right corner of room 202 OSH. I've had classes in this room for the past 3 semesters each time one specific chair decides the ass upon it is not worthy.

Was just told, "girls who drink have no personalities". Excuse me while I go get drunk to compensate for your personality.

What if you could tinder in real life? Like walk up to someone and be like *swipe right* then they're like *swipe right* and then you know you're in and won't be rejected? That would be cool.

Sometimes I get discouraged going to to workout at the field house because I look at all these people with great bodies and I'm like a 4 but then I realize that I'll  look like them one day

What your school says about you: BYU: "I'm ready for marriage and divorce at 22" UofU: "I'm a rich foreigner with a luxury car" UVU: "Are we accredited?" West Mini: "I like to think I'm Ivy League"

LOL at the guy on the second floor of the library, who freely farted loud and proud and giggled to himself about it. Carry on.

Biking on campus thats great. Just slow down when you are not on a bike path. Just saw a biker almost run into a guy at full speed.

Fuck off, protesters. You're protesting a police department that had nothing to do with the recent incidents of brutality. Hell, they're campus cops.

There's a time and a place for everything, so a protest anywhere on campus isn't the time nor the place.

A protestor told me to join the protest against the murder of Eric Brown. It's Eric Garner you fucking dumbass. You don't even know why or what you're protesting.

If you're going to blast your music at 1000 decibels, at least don't play "Pumped Up Kicks" for two hours straight. Much appreciated.

don't reply to a yak with "no one cares about what you think" because the whole point of the app is that you care enough to read what strangers are putting up.

I bet ΣΧ knew Tyga wouldn't show- like that was apart of their contract deal. Even if they shared some of the ticket sales with him, they'd still make a ton! Think about it..... Conspiracy Theory!

I'm going to hide my alarm in my room so when I'm gone, it will keep running until he finds it. That's what you get for being an ass.

To those of you making your first ever trip to the library this semester: please don't ruin this horribly sanctuary. Some of us call this place home. In other words, shut the fuck up.

When describing if you think you are attractive or not.. You're always labeled as narcissistic, oblivious or insecure.
