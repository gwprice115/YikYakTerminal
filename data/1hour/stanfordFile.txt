It doesn't really bother me when I hear footsteps through the ceiling of my room...until I remember I live on the top floor this year. Construction on my roof or a ghost?

If you're staying here over break, or even if you're not, I encourage you to wander around campus sometime at 3 or 4am. It helps put things here in a completely new perspective.

Cleavage is the biggest lie. It's like in elementary school when you were all excited to open a bag of Lays. And when you finally did it was more than half empty...

As a woman of color, I find Stanford's overbearing political correctness very very uncomfortable. The very fact that I had to say I was a woman of color to deter some hate is the reason why.

Political correctness is a stupid word. What do we really mean by it? Listening to rules of minorities that seem random to us? Maybe listen/talk about _why_ people're upset instead... BOTH sides.

Based on everything that I've heard and read on the case, I thought it was pretty clear that grand jury's verdict was correct.

Please don't take food that people have labeled and put in the dorm fridge. It's not nice and it's the most disappointing feeling to find out someone stole your food.

Please keep in mind that images of looting that you see are seeing are not the ONLY types of protests happening in STL. Looting and violence make better television than peaceful protests.

The indictment is about the incident, not what statistics from the past say. You don't punish a man, regardless the color of their skin, for the actions of people before them.

Anyone know when the off-campus part of the walkout starts tomorrow?  Possibly bike-less so want to know the drop-dead be-at-the-quad-by time (which i assume isn't 10, because that's leave-class time)

I'm not surprised I wish that I could turn back time to 1week ago, but tbh, I've learned to accept that I'd likely spend my week the same way again.

No matter what side you are on concerning Ferguson, we can all agree the police need body cameras to prevent speculation and confusion. If Wilson had a camera, this would have been over day one.

Look closer at the information you're being fed, evaluate your prejudices, fix them, wisen yourself to the experiences of others (read: listen), learn empathy, be a human being with a heart..

We speak two languages of racism here. Overt racism and racial biases. One is easy to see and the other? Not so much. Let's keep the latter in mind when talking about Ferguson.

I love yik yak for making us all fully aware of how much everyone is struggling. Not feeling alone makes dead week a tiny bit more manageable. Best of luck to everyone.

When you professor thinks he's a standup comedian and wastes times in class and you're like "it's week 10 just tell me what's gonna be on the final"

Pro-tip: Wear black athletic shorts in the rain. Less material that dries quickly and looks good wet.

I managed to bike while holding an umbrella today. That's it. I'm done. I've learned the most valuable thing this school has to offer.

Honestly,  I don't want to talk about your startup or perfect GPA or even ISIS at the table.  I'd prefer a conversation about other things.  Like the weather, or a movie,  anything else really.

I'm starting to wonder if my roommate wraps his whole hand in toilet paper before one wipe. Every time I go into the bathroom half the roll is gone.

Whether you got a B or a B+ in that one class, a C or a C+ in another class, it doesn't really matter in the scheme of things. Work hard, but don't overwork yourself. You go to Stanford after all!
